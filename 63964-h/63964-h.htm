<small>HER FATHER&#8217;S DEATH</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> in my twenty-fourth year when I underwent
the tragic and amazing experiences
which, with the help of a friend, I propose to
relate in these pages. I am now seventy-seven;
but I am in good health and enjoy
all my faculties, saving my hearing; my
memory is brisk, and my friends find it very
faithful, and what is here set down you may
accept as the truth.</p>

<p>It is long ago since the last convict ship
sailed away from these shores with her horrid
burden of guilt and grief and passions of a
hundred devilish sorts; I don&#8217;t know how
long it is since the last of the convict ships
passed down Channel on her way to colonies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
which were like to become a sort of shambles&mdash;for
they were hanging half a score of men
a day for murder in those times&mdash;if this
horrid commerce in felons had not ended;
when that ship had weighed and sailed she
passed away to return no more as a prison
craft. When she faded out of sight she was
a vanished type, and when she climbed,
moon-like, above the horizon under full
breast of shining canvas, she was an honest
ship again, never more to be debauched by
opportunities to tender for the transport of
criminals.</p>

<p>Before I lift the curtain upon my ship,
the Convict Ship in which I sailed, I must
hold you in talk concerning some matters
which go before the sailing of the vessel; for
I have to explain how it came about that I,
a woman, was on board of a convict ship
full of male malefactors.</p>

<p>I was born in the parish of Stepney in the
year 1814. My father was Mr. Benjamin
Johnstone, a well-known man&mdash;locally, I
mean&mdash;in his day. He had been put to sea
as a boy very young; had risen steadily and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
made his way to command, saved money with
a liberal thriftiness that enabled him to enjoy
life modestly and to hold the respect of his
friends. He built a little ship for a venture,
did well, bought or built a second, and at the
age of forty-five owned a fleet of four or five
coasters, all trading out of the Thames. He
purchased a house at Stepney for the convenience
of the district.</p>

<p>At Stepney in my young days lived many
respectable families, and I don&#8217;t doubt that
many respectable families still live at Stepney;
but it is true that all that part of London has
sunk since I was a little girl, and the sort of
people who flourished in the east in the
beginning of the century have now gone west
with the jerry trowel and the nine-inch wall.
My father&#8217;s house in Stepney might have been
a lord&#8217;s in its time. It was strong as a fortress,
cosy and homely, rich within doors with
the colouring of age. It still stands; I visited
it last year, but it is no longer a private
house.</p>

<p>I was about twelve years old when my
father died. The manner of his going was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
very sudden and fearful, and, old as I am,
when I think of it I feel afraid, so haunting
is youthful impression, the shock of it often
trembling through the longest years into the
last beats of one&#8217;s heart. My cousin, Will
Johnstone, had been brought over from his
house near the Tower to spend the afternoon
with me. He was between six and seven
years of age, a fine little manly boy, the only
son of my father&#8217;s brother, William Johnstone,
a lawyer, whose house and office were near
the Tower. This little Will and I sat at the
table in the parlour, playing at some game,
and very noisy.</p>

<p>It was a November afternoon, the atmosphere
of a true London sullenness; the fire
burnt heartily, and the walls were merry
with the dance of the flames, and the candle
stood unlighted upon the mantelpiece. My
father sat in an arm-chair close to the fire;
he smoked a long clay pipe, and his eyes
were fixed upon the glowing coals. He was
a handsome man; I have his image before
me. He had the completest air of a sailor
that is to be figured. I seldom see such faces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
as his now. But then faces belong to times.
My father&#8217;s belonged to his century; and you
would seek for it there and not before nor
after.</p>

<p>He sat with his legs crossed and his eyes
upon the fire. Suddenly looking around, he
cried, with some temper: &#8216;Not so much
noise, little &#8217;uns! not so much noise, or you&#8217;ll
have to go to bed.&#8217; Then his face relaxed,
and I, with my child&#8217;s eyes, saw he was sorry
for having spoken so sharply. &#8216;Little ones,&#8217;
said he softly, &#8216;let&#8217;s have a game. Let&#8217;s see
who can go to sleep first and keep asleep
longest;&#8217; and dropping his hand so as to bring
the pipe from his mouth, he sank his chin
and shut his eyes, and snored once or twice
as a make-believe.</p>

<p>I sank my head and closed my eyes as
father had, and little Will shammed to be
asleep. We were silent a minute or more.
The pipe then fell from my father&#8217;s hand and
lay in halves upon the floor. There was
nothing in this. It was a common clay pipe,
and father would break such things pretty
nearly as often as he smoked them. I now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
peeped at Will; he was peeping at me. The
child giggled, and burst into a little half-suffocated
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush!&#8217; said I; and now, being weary of
this sort of sport, I looked at father and cried
out: &#8216;I can&#8217;t sleep any longer.&#8217;</p>

<p>He never answered, so I stepped round
the table to his chair to wake him up,
and pulled him by the arm, and still he
would not answer. I climbed upon his knee,
and just then a bright gas flame spurted out
of a lump of coal, and I saw his face very
clearly. What was there in it to acquaint
my childish sight with the thing that had
come to him? I fell from his knee and ran
to the door, and shrieked for mother. She
was in the next room, or back parlour, talking
with a woman hired to sew.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mother,&#8217; said I, &#8216;father can&#8217;t wake up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you mean, Marian? Where is
he?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We have been playing at sleep, and he
can&#8217;t wake up,&#8217; said I, and I began to cry.</p>

<p>She went into the room with a fear and
wildness in her manner, stopped to lean upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the table and look at her husband, and in
that pause I see her now, though it did not
pass beyond the space of a few heart-beats.
She was about thirty-five years of age, a very
fine figure of a woman indeed, with a vast
profusion of yellow hair, of which she was
exceedingly vain, often changing the fashion
of wearing it two and three times in a week.
The firelight was upon her face, and she
showed like marble as she gazed at father
with a hand under her left breast. Then running
up to him she looked close, cried out,
and fell in a swoon upon the floor. Will and
I were horribly frightened, and screamed together.
This brought the servants and the
sewing-woman to us. A doctor was sent for,
and when he arrived and examined father he
pronounced him dead.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of my mother that
she should faint when she looked at my
father and believed him dead, though for all
she knew he might have been in a fit, wanting
instant attention to preserve him from
death. She was a tender mother, and, I
believe, did her best to be a good wife; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
she had not strength of character; she was
pretty and thought herself beautiful, and was
more easily to be cheated by flatterers than
any woman I ever met in my life. Her weakness
in this way was the cause of much unhappiness
to me, of many a bitter secret tear
some years after my father&#8217;s death, as I will
explain a little way farther on.</p>

<small>HER MEMORIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I missed</span> my father out of my life as though the
sun had gone out of the heavens. I had been
far more of a companion to him than my mother.
I had venerated him as something superior
to all created beings; which, I dare say, was
not a little owing to his stories of the sea, to
the various wonders he was able to recount,
and to his descriptions of distant lands, as
remote as the stars to my young imagination.
The company he kept was nearly wholly
composed of sailors, sea captains, either
retired or actively employed. My mother
would often be out visiting, passing an
evening at a card party, or at a dance at
some neighbour&#8217;s when our parlour, which
was long and wide, but low-ceiled, like a
ship&#8217;s cabin, would be half-full of father&#8217;s
nautical friends. I&#8217;d sit and listen then to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
their talk; for mother being absent there&#8217;d
be nobody to bid me go to bed&mdash;as to father,
he would have let me sit until he went to bed
himself. Thus it was I heard so much talk of
the sea, that I was able to discourse on ships
and rigging, on high seas and gales of wind,
on icebergs, whales and uncharted shoals,
as though I had never lived out of a forecastle.
Indeed, I knew too much. I was
often pert, lifted up my shrill voice in correction
of some old captain, and so would
raise a very thunder of laughter and applause
in the room.</p>

<p>Again, I was often my father&#8217;s companion
in the trips he made in his own coasters down
the river. Those excursions were the golden
hours of my childhood. We&#8217;d row on board
a little brig weighing from the Pool, and stay
in the ship till we were off Gravesend, where
we&#8217;d land. Mother never joined us. When
the wind caused the vessel to lay over she
said it made her sick. I dare say it did.</p>

<p>Father&#8217;s little fleet was mainly composed
of coasters, as I have said, grimy of deck for
the most part, with a strong smell of the bilge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
in the atmosphere of their darksome cabins,
wagons in shape and staggerers in their gait,
with a lean and coaly look aloft as they
heeled, black and gaunt, from bank to bank
of the river over the smooth stream of ebb or
flood. But those trips made choice hours to
me, and are sweeter than the memories of
sport in the summer grass and of hunts in the
rank growths of ditches and the country
hedge.</p>

<p>I remember that during one of these
trips we nearly ran down a large boat when
we were not very far from Woolwich, lying
over with the wind ahead and the water
spitting briskly at our forefoot. I went to
the side to look; she was a big boat with
soldiers in her, and full of strange-looking
men in gray clothes and a sort of Scotch cap.
I saw the irons upon those men as the boat
swept close past and heard the clank of the
chains as the wretches shrank or started in
terror at the sight of the mass of our bare,
black hull, rolling like a storm-cloud almost
right over them. Father was below. I
asked Mr. Smears, the master of the brig,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
who stood close alongside of me in a tall,
rusty hat and a stout coat that descended to
within a foot of his heels, what boat that was.</p>

<p>&#8216;A convict boat, missy,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are those people in her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rogues all, missy&mdash;rogues all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are they going to?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He pointed to a great wooden hulk that
lay off Woolwich, the hull of a man-of-war,
made hideous by a variety of deck erections,
and by rows of linen fluttering betwixt the
poles which rose out of her decks.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s where they&#8217;re going to,&#8217; said Mr.
Smears. &#8216;And shall I tell &#8217;ee who&#8217;s the
skipper of that craft? &#8217;Taint no Government
bloke&mdash;let ne&#8217;er a man believe it! The skipper&#8217;s
name begins with a D and ends with a
h-L. I&#8217;m not going to say more, missy.
Father&#8217;ll supply ye with the missing letters.
Yond skipper&#8217;s name begins with a D and
ends with a h-L, and them livelies in gray,&#8217;
said he, nodding toward the boat we had
nearly run down, &#8216;are his young &#8217;uns, and
they do credit to their parient, if looks
ain&#8217;t lies.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>Then, starting up, he cried: &#8216;Ready
about, lads!&#8217; and a moment later the helm
was put down and our canvas was wildly
shaking, and then the brig heeled over and
with steady sails ripped through the yellow
lustrous surface of the river&#8217;s breast on her
slanting course down Woolwich Reach.</p>

<p>I did not long look at the great hull of
the old man-of-war and her hideous deck
erections and her flapping prison linen. I
was a child, with a child&#8217;s eye for beauty,
and my gaze would quickly wander from the
prison-ship which I was altogether too young
to quicken and inform with the loathsome
fascination one finds in all such abodes of
human crime and miserable mortal distress;
I say my eye would quickly turn from that
horrible floating jail to the fifty sights of
movement and colour round about; to the
hoy with its cargo of passengers from Margate
and a fiddle and a harp making music in the
bows lazily stemming Londonward; to the
barge going away with the tide, sending a
scent of rich country across the wind from its
lofty cargo of hay on whose summit lies a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
man on his back, sound asleep; to the large
ship fresh from the other side of the world
with sailors dangling aloft, and a merry echo
of capstanpawls timing a little crowd of men
running round and round her forecastle; the
wife of the captain aft talking to a waterman
in a wherry over the side, and the captain
himself, baked brown by the suns of three or
four great oceans, excitedly stepping from
rail to rail in a walk of impassioned anxiety
and impatience.</p>

<p>I have the words, you see! Does the
language of the deep sound strange in the
mouth of a woman? The wives and daughters
of military men may deliver themselves in
the speech of the barracks and nobody thinks
anything of it. Why should not the daughter
of a sailor and the wife of a sailor possess the
language of her father and of her husband&#8217;s
profession, and talk it whenever the need
arises without raising wonder?</p>

<p>After my father&#8217;s death, his little fleet of
ships were sold, in accordance with the direction
of his will. The thing was bungled. My
mother was a poor woman of business. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
fell out with my uncle, William Johnstone,
over the sale of the vessels, and put the
business in the hands of a broker, who robbed
us. Yet, when the estate was realised, we
were pretty well to do. The freehold in Stepney
was to come to me at the death of my
mother. Under my father&#8217;s will there was a
settlement that secured me three hundred
pounds a year. The trustees were two sea-captains.
My mother was well provided for;
but one saw, by the terms of my father&#8217;s will,
that he had no confidence in her. Yet he did
not stipulate that she should not marry
again; though, had I been older at the time,
I should have looked for some condition of
the sort, for he was very jealous. In fine,
and what I have to relate obliges me to dwell
upon these trumpery particulars, my father&#8217;s
will gave me his house at my mother&#8217;s death,
and secured three hundred pounds a year to
me in any case when I should become of age
or on my marriage, the interest meanwhile to
grow and be mine; and then, at my mother&#8217;s
death, a portion of what had been willed to
her was to revert to me, and the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
was to be distributed amongst two or three
poor and distant relations and a few charities,
all of them maritime.</p>

<p>Thus, at my father&#8217;s death, I might fairly
have been described by a forward-looking
eye as what you would call a tolerably fair
match; and at the age of seventeen I deserved
to be thought so, not only because
of my money and the pleasant old house that
would be mine, but because of my good
looks. At seventy-seven there can be no
vanity in retrospect. Moreover, since this
story is to be told, you shall have the whole
truth. At seventeen, then, I was a tall, strong,
well-made girl, broad, but in proportion, and
they used to tell me that I carried my figure
with the grace of a professional dancer. I
was exactly opposite to my mother in
colour. My hair was black as the wing of a
raven; my eyes very black and filled with a
strong light, which brightened to a look of
fever in times of excitement; my complexion
was pale but clear; my teeth large, white,
and regular, and I showed them much in
talking and laughing. I&#8217;ll not deny that my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
charms&mdash;and handsome I truly was&mdash;inclined
to coarseness; by which I mean that they
leaned toward the manly rather than the
womanly side. My voice was a contralto,
and when I sang I would sink to a note
that was reckoned uncommonly deep for a
girl.</p>

<p>My father had been dead about five years,
when, one afternoon, my mother came to me
in my bedroom. She was in her bonnet and
outdoor clothes, and I instantly noticed an
agitation in her manner as she sat down
beside the dressing-table and looked at me. I
forget what I was about, but I recollect ceasing
in it and standing up with my hands clasped,
whilst I viewed her anxiously and with misgivings.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said she, with a forced smile,
&#8216;I have come to give you a bit of news.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What, mother?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My hand has been asked in marriage,
dear, and I have accepted.&#8217;</p>

<p>I felt the blood rush to my face, and then
I turned cold, and, pulling a chair to me, sat
down, but I did not speak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8216;Do you hear me, child?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Your hand has been asked in marriage?&#8217;
said I. &#8216;By whom, mother?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;By Mr. Stanford,&#8217; she answered, lowering
her voice and sinking her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Stanford?&#8217; I cried. &#8216;The doctor?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Whom else?&#8217; she replied, looking at me
again and forcing another smile.</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck. Never for an instant
had I suspected that there was more
between them than such commonplace, matter-of-fact
friendship as may exist between a
medical man and those whom he attends.
Mr. Stanford was the doctor one of the servants
had run for when my father died. He
had attended us during the preceding year,
and he had prescribed for mother and me
since, so that at this date we had known him
six years. He was a widower and childless,
and lived within ten minutes&#8217; walk of our
house. Occasionally he had looked in upon
us, and sat during an evening for an hour or
so; sometimes he had dined with us and we
with him; but never had I observed any sort
of behaviour in him or mother to hint at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
what was coming&mdash;at what, indeed, had now
come.</p>

<p>I should be needlessly detaining you from
my own story to repeat all that passed between
my mother and me on this occasion. I
was beside myself with anger, mortification,
jealousy&mdash;for I was jealous of my father&#8217;s
memory, abhorred the thought of his place
being taken in his own house and in the
affection of the wife whom he had loved, by
such a man as Mr. Stanford. Nay, but it
would have been all the same had Mr. Stanford
been the greatest nobleman or the first
character in Europe. I should have abominated
him as an intruder, and have yearned
for the hands of a man to toss him out o&#8217;
window should he dare to occupy a house in
which my father was as real a presence to
my heart as though he were still alive and
could kiss me and make me presents and
carry me away out of the gloomy streets into
the shining holiday road of the river.</p>

<p>My mother reproached me, and pleaded
and wept. The weakness of her poor heart,
God rest her, was very visible at this time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
She clung to me and held me to her, imploring
me, as her only child, to consider
how lonely she was, how sadly she stood in
need of a protector, how good it would be
for us both to have Mr. Stanford to watch
over us! I broke away from her with a wet
scarlet face and heaving bosom, and told her
that if Mr. Stanford took my father&#8217;s place I
would cease to love or even to think of her
as my mother. We both cried bitterly, and
raised our voices and talked together as most
women would at such a moment, not knowing
what each other said. I do not condemn
myself. I look back and hold that I was
right to stand up for the memory of my
beloved father, even to rage as I did against
my mother&#8217;s resolution to marry Mr. Stanford.
I wondered at her; indeed, I was shocked.
I was young and ardent and romantic, had a
girl&#8217;s notions of the loyalty of love and the
obligations of keeping sacred the memory
and the place of one who had been faithful
and tender, who had nobly done his duty to
his wife and child.</p>

<small>HER MOTHER DIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the age of seventeen I considered myself
qualified to form a judgment of men, and I
was amazed and indeed disgusted that my
mother should see anything in Mr. Stanford
to please her. He and my father were at
the opposite ends of the sex, as far removed
as the bows from the stern of a ship. He
was a spare and narrow man, pale as veal, in
complexion sandy, the expression of his countenance
hard and acid, his eyes large and
moist and the larger and moister for the magnifying
spectacles he wore. But my mother
would have her way, and a week after she
had given me the news of the doctor&#8217;s offer
they were privately married.</p>

<p>My life from this date was one of constant
and secret unhappiness. I could never answer
Mr. Stanford with any approach to civility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
without a violent effort. He strove at first to
make friends with me, then gave up and took
no more heed of me than had I been a
shadow at the table or about the house.
Yet, sometimes, I would make him pretty
rudely and severely feel that he was an intruder,
an abomination in my sight, a scandalous
illustration of my mother&#8217;s weakness
of nature; and that was if ever he opened
his lips about my father. I never suffered
him to mention my father&#8217;s name in my presence.
He might be about to speak intending
to praise, designing every manner of civility
toward the memory of the dead; I minded
him not; if he named my father I insulted
him, and on two or three occasions forced
him to quit the table, so strong and fiery was
the injurious language I plied him with. My
mother wept, threatened to swoon, did swoon
once, and our home promised to become as
wretched and clamorous as a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>As an example of my hatred, not so much
of the man as of his assumption of my father&#8217;s
place: he brought his door-plate and his lamp
from his house, and when I saw his plate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
upon the door that my father used to go in
and out of I ran to a carpenter who lived a
few streets off, brought him back with his
tools, and ordered him to remove the plate,
which I threw into the kitchen sink for the
cook to find and report to her master.</p>

<p>Well, at the end of ten months, my mother
died in childbed. The infant lived. It was a
girl. My mother died; and when I went to
her bedside and viewed her dead face, sweet
in its everlasting sleep, for the look and wear
of ten or fifteen years seemed to have been
brushed off her countenance by the hand of
death, I thought to myself: if she has gone
to meet father, how will she excuse herself for
her disloyalty? And then the little new-born
babe that was in the next room began to cry,
and I came away from that death-bed with
tearless eyes and sat in my bedroom, thinking
without weeping.</p>

<p>I have spoken of my uncle, William Johnstone,
a lawyer, who lived in the neighbourhood
of the Tower, and whose office was in
his own dwelling-house. He, like my father,
had but one child, Will Johnstone, that little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
fellow who was playing with me when my
father died. Mr. Johnstone&#8217;s was a very comfortable
house; it afterward passed into the
hands of a chart-seller. His clients were
nearly wholly composed of sea-going people.
He was said to be very learned in maritime
law; he was much consulted by masters and
mates with grievances, and at his house, as at
my father&#8217;s formerly, you&#8217;d meet few people
who did not follow the ocean or did not do
business with seafarers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnstone was three or four years
older than her husband. She was a plain,
homely, thoroughly good-hearted woman, incapable
of an ill-natured thought; one of
those few people who are content to be as
God made them. During my mother&#8217;s brief
married life with her second husband I was
constantly with my aunt, and I believe I
should have lived with her wholly but for
my determination that my stepfather, the
doctor, should not flatter himself he had
sickened me out of my own home. Will was
at this time at the Bluecoat School, laying in
a stock of Latin and Greek for the fishes;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
for the lad was resolved to go to sea. His
father, indeed, wished him to adopt that
calling, and would say: &#8216;What is the good
of a cargo of learning the whole of which will
be thrown up overboard the first dirty night
down Channel?&#8217;</p>

<p>When mother died, my aunt entreated
me to live with her and leave the doctor
alone in his glory. My answer was: No, I
should not think of leaving my own home if
my stepfather were out of it, and I was not
to be driven out because he chose to stay.
I had the power to turn him out, and should
have done so but for the baby. The little
one was my mother&#8217;s; I could not have
turned a child of my mother&#8217;s out of a home
that had been my mother&#8217;s. So I continued
to live in the home that had come to me
from my father. I occupied a set of rooms
over the parlour-floor and took my meals in
my own apartments, where I was attended
by a maid who waited upon me and upon
nobody else.</p>

<p>The child was called after my mother,
and her name was mine&mdash;Marian. If in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
passing up or down stairs I met the little
creature in its nurse&#8217;s arms, I would take
it and kiss it, perhaps, and toss it a moment
or two and then go my way. God forgive
me, I could never bring myself to love that
child. I never could think of it as my
mother&#8217;s, but as Mr. Stanford&#8217;s. The sight,
the sound of it would bring all my father
into my heart, and I&#8217;d fall into a sort of
passion merely in thinking that the memory
of such a man should have been betrayed.</p>

<p>I dare say you will consider all this as an
excess of loyalty in me. But loyal even to
exaggeration my nature was to those I loved.
It is no boast&mdash;merely a saying which this
tale should justify.</p>

<p>After the death of my mother, the money
paid to me through my trustees rose to an
income of hard upon five hundred a year.
I rejoice to say that Mr. Stanford got not
one penny. My mother had been without
the power to will away a farthing of what
my father had left her. Otherwise I don&#8217;t
doubt the doctor would have come off with
something more substantial than a ten-month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
memory and my sullen toleration of his plate
upon the door.</p>

<p>The equivalent in these times of five
hundred a year would in those be about
seven hundred; I was, therefore, a fortune
and a fine, handsome young woman besides;
and you will naturally ask: Had I any sweethearts,
lovers, followers? To tell you the
truth, I never gave men nor marriage a
thought. I had friends in the neighbourhood,
and I went among them, and I was
also much at my aunt&#8217;s, and not very easily,
therefore, to be caught at home by any gentleman
with an eye to a fine girl and an
independency. Add likewise to my visiting,
a great love of solitary rambling. I&#8217;d take a
boat at Wapping and pass nearly a whole
day upon the river, stepping ashore, perhaps,
at some convenient landing-stairs or stage for
a meal, and then returning to the wherry.
Ah, those were delicious jaunts! They stand
next in my memory in sweetness and happiness
to those father had carried me on. I
made nothing of being alone, and nobody
took any notice of me. I was affronted but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
once, and that was by a Wapping waterman
who claimed that I had promised to use his
boat, which was false. He was a poor
creature, and nothing but the modesty of
my sex hindered me from beating him with
the short stout stick, silver-headed, with lead
under the silver, that I always carried with
me when I went alone. Another waterman
whom I employed came up while the low
fellow was slanging me, whipped off his coat
like lightning and in five minutes blacked up
both his opponent&#8217;s eyes. This was punishment
enough, and I was satisfied; and, as a
reward, paid the chivalrous man double fare
and made a point to hire his boat afterwards.</p>

<p>Or I would take my passage in a Calais
steamer, land at Gravesend, or perhaps higher
up, and wander about, perfectly happy in
being alone, and with eyes and thoughts for
nothing but the beauties of the country and
the bright scene of the river. Often I was
away for two and three days together; but
on these occasions I always chose an inn
where I was known, where I could depend
upon the comfort of the entertainment and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the security of the house; where the landlady
would welcome me as a friend, and
provide me for the night with such little
conveniences as I had left my home without.
Everything was caprice with me in those
days. I did what I liked, went where I
liked, knew no master. My aunt once or
twice, in her mild way, questioned the propriety
of a young woman acting as I did,
but my uncle stood up for me, pointed out
that my blood was full of the old roaming
instincts of my father; that I was quite old
enough and strong enough to take care of
myself; that what I did was my notion of
enjoyment, and that I was in the right to be
happy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Keep on the wing while you can,&#8217; said
he. &#8216;Some of these days a big chap called a
husband will come along, with a pair of shears
in his hand, and the rest will be short farmyard
hops.&#8217;</p>

<p>On the other hand, my stepfather professed
to be scandalised by my conduct. He
marched into my room one day, after I had
spent the night alone at Gravesend, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
asked leave to have a serious talk with me.
But, on his beginning to tell me that I was
not acting with that sort of decorum, with
that regard to social observances, which is
always expected and looked for in a young
lady, I walked out of the room. He then
addressed a long letter to me. His drift was
still decorum and social observances, and
what would his patients think. <i>I</i> thought of
my father and how <i>he</i> would deal with this
fellow, who was daring enough to teach me
how to conduct myself, and in a passion I
tore the letter in halves, slipped the pieces
into an envelope, on which I wrote, &#8216;Your
advice is as objectionable as your company,&#8217;
and bade my maid put the letter on the table
of the room in which he received his patients.</p>

<p>But this is not telling you whether I had
lovers, sweethearts, followers, or not. I have
no room to go into that matter here; yet, let
me name two young gentlemen. The first
was the son of one of my trustees, Captain
Galloway, who lived at Shadwell. The youth
was good-looking, and had a pleasant, easy
manner; he had been well educated, and at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
this time held some post of small consequence
in the London Docks. He hung about me
much, contrived to meet me at friends&#8217; houses,
often called, and managed sometimes to discover
whither I had gone on a ramble, and
to meet me as though by accident. I never
doubted that I owed a good deal of this lad&#8217;s
attention to old Captain Galloway&#8217;s fatherly
advice. I laughed in my sleeve at the poor
boy, though I was always gentle and kind to
him; and if I never gave him any marked
encouragement, for his father&#8217;s sake I took
care never to pain or in any way disconcert
him; until one evening, happening to be at a
quadrille party, to which he had been invited,
though he did not attend, a pretty, sad-faced
young creature was pointed out to me as a
girl whom Jim Galloway had jilted so provokingly
as to earn him a caning at the hands
of the young lady&#8217;s brother. This was enough
for me. I first made sure that the story was
true, and when next I met my youthful
admirer I took him on one side, and, having
told him what I had heard, informed him
that he was a wicked, dangerous boy, unfit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
for the society of ladies, and, affecting a great
air of indignation, I asked if by his hanging
about me he did not intend to make a fool of
me too. What passed put an end to the
young gentleman&#8217;s addresses; but I always
regret that this affair should have occasioned
a coolness between Captain Galloway and
myself.</p>

<p>My second suitor, or follower, so to term
the fellow, was no less a person than my stepfather&#8217;s
nephew. I had been spending my
twenty-first birthday at my aunt&#8217;s, and on my
return home Mr. Stanford sent up word to
know if I would see him. I was in a good
humour, and told the maid to ask my stepfather
up. His motive in visiting me was to
get me to allow him to invite his nephew to
stay in the house. He wished to make his
nephew&#8217;s better acquaintance. The youth
was studying medicine, and Mr. Stanford believed
a time might come when it would be
convenient to take him into partnership. I
told him to ask his nephew and welcome.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the gentleman&#8217;s name?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Edward Potter,&#8217; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>In two or three days&#8217; time Mr. Edward
Potter drove up in a hackney coach. He
brought a quantity of luggage, insomuch that
I reckoned the partnership might not be so
far off as my stepfather had hinted. Mr.
Potter was a very corpulent young man; his
neck was formed of rings of fat, and his small-clothes
and arm sleeves sheathed his limbs as
tight as a bladder holds lard. Nothing remarkable
happened for some time, and then I
discovered that this pursy young man was
beginning to pay me some attention. To be
sure, his opportunities in this way were few;
he dared not enter my rooms without being
invited, and then again, as you know, I was
much away from home. Yet he would contrive
to waylay me on the stairs and hold me
in conversation, and he once went to the
length of snatching up his hat and passing
with me into the street, and walking with
me down the Commercial Road to as far
as Whitechapel, where I managed to shake
him off.</p>

<p>One afternoon, on going downstairs, I heard
the sound of voices in the parlour. The door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
stood ajar; my name was uttered; and the
sound of it arrested my steps. The voices
within were those of Mr. Stanford and his
nephew, who were still at table, lingering
over their wine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, she has the temper of a devil,&#8217; said
my stepfather. &#8216;I love her so exceedingly
that I&#8217;d like nothing better than to have her
for a patient. But the wench&#8217;s constitution is
as sound as her fortune. Why don&#8217;t you go
ahead with her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s plaguy hard to get at,&#8217; said Mr.
Potter, in his strange voice, as though his
mouth was full of grease.</p>

<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t shove enough,&#8217; said his uncle.
&#8216;A woman of her sort isn&#8217;t to be won by
staring and breathing hard. Go for her
boldly. Blunder into the sitting-room sometimes,
follow her when she goes out and meet
her round the next corner. It was the
chance I spoke to your mother about and
that you&#8217;re here for. She means five hundred
a year and this house. You&#8217;ll need to kill or
cure scores this way to earn five hundred a
year.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>&#8216;It&#8217;s like taking a naked light into a
powder magazine to talk to her,&#8217; said Mr.
Potter. &#8216;Every look she gives one is a sort of
explosion. I always feel like wishing that
the road may be clear when I address her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re too fat for business,&#8217; said his
uncle. &#8216;I feared so. Give me a lean and
hungry man for spirit. C&aelig;sar knew Cassius,
and I know you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I guessed it was Mr. Potter who thumped
the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;Give me some time and you&#8217;ll see,&#8217; he
said. &#8216;But in proportion as she troubles me
on this side so I&#8217;ll give it her on t&#8217;other.
Only let me get her, and for all your sneers at
my figure I&#8217;ll have her on her knees to you
and me within a month. Will you bet?&#8217; and
I heard him pound the table again.</p>

<p>He had used a word in this speech which
I will not repeat&mdash;an odious, infamous word.
I stepped in, flinging the door wide open and
leaving it so. Mr. Potter started up from
his chair, my stepfather lay back, his face
drooped and very pale, and he looked at me
under his half-closed lids. I stared Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Potter in the face for a few moments without
speaking; I then pointed to the door with
the silver-headed cane I invariably carried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Walk out, sir,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He began to stammer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Walk out!&#8217; I repeated, and I menaced
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where am I to walk to?&#8217; he said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Out of this house,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You had no right to listen, miss,&#8217; said
my stepfather.</p>

<p>I looked at him, then stepped round the
table to the bell, which I pulled violently.
My own maid, guessing the summons was
mine, answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Jane,&#8217; said I, &#8216;go instantly for a constable.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There is no need to fetch a constable,&#8217;
exclaimed Mr. Stanford, getting up, &#8216;my
nephew will leave the house.&#8217;</p>

<p>On this, Mr. Potter went out into the hall,
and whilst he fumbled at the hatstand, called
out:</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose I may take my luggage?&#8217;</p>

<p>I was determined to humble the dog to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
an extremity, and told Jane to call in any two
idle fellows she could see to remove Mr.
Potter&#8217;s luggage. She fetched two men from
a public-house, and I took them upstairs into
Mr. Potter&#8217;s room and bade them carry his
trunks below and put them on the pavement.
When they had carried the trunks downstairs
they returned for Mr. Potter&#8217;s loose, unpacked
apparel, which, acting on my instructions,
they heaped along with his unpacked linen
on top of the boxes on the pavement. I paid
the two men for their trouble, and violently
slammed the hall-door upon Mr. Potter, who
stood in the road, gazed at by a fast-gathering
crowd, waiting for the arrival of a hackney
coach, which was very slow in coming.</p>

<p>As I passed upstairs, panting and heart-sick,
Mr. Stanford came into the hall, and
called out: &#8216;You will ruin my practice.&#8217; I
paused to see if he had more to say, and I was
very thankful afterward that he had thought
proper to immediately retire on observing me
stop.</p>

<small>SHE MEETS CAPTAIN BUTLER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this business you might suppose that
Mr. Stanford made haste to remove his plate
and his lamp to his old or another house.
Not at all. He found it convenient to stay;
and I contrived to endure him for the sake of
the child, that was now between three and
four years of age: a poor, feeble little creature,
with but slender promise of life in its
white face and thin frame.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the trouble with Mr.
Potter had happened I went to my uncle&#8217;s
house near the Tower to sup and spend the
evening. As with Stepney, so with this part;
it has sunk pretty low. Yet when I was a
girl some very respectable families lived in
the neighbourhood of the Tower. My uncle&#8217;s
house, as I have said, included his offices.
They had been the front and back parlours.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
In the front office sat a couple of clerks, and
the back was my uncle&#8217;s private office, where
he received his clients. The family occupied
the upper part of the house, according to the
good old fashion of trade, when men were not
ashamed of their business. The rooms above
corresponded with the offices below: the front
room was furnished as a drawing-room; the
back as a parlour.</p>

<p>I was as much at home in my uncle&#8217;s
house as if I had been his child, and, passing
the servants who opened the door, I went
upstairs to my aunt&#8217;s bedroom to take off my
bonnet and brush my hair. On the landing I
heard voices in the drawing-room. I guessed
my uncle had company, and hoped, unless
there were others, that it was not old Mr.
Simmonds, a ship-broker, a person to whom
my uncle was always very civil and hospitable,
as being useful in business, but who, to
my mind, was the most wearisome, insipid,
teasing old man that ever chair groaned
under.</p>

<p>I removed my bonnet&mdash;you would laugh,
were you to see the great, coal-scuttle-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
contrivance it was&mdash;brushed my hair, viewed
myself a little complacently, for it was an
April day, the wind brisk, and my walk had
put some colour into my cheeks, from which
my dark eyes took a clearer fire, and went to
the drawing-room. On entering I found my
uncle sitting with a gentleman. The stranger
was not Mr. Simmonds. My aunt stood at
the window, looking out.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, here am I watching for you!&#8217; said
she. &#8216;Marian, my dear, Captain Butler.&#8217;</p>

<p>I dropped the stranger a curtsey of those
times, and with a quick glance gathered him.
Small need to call him captain to know he
was a sailor. His weather-darkened face, the
fashion of his clothes, the indescribable ocean-rolling
ease of his manner of rising and bowing
to me, were assurance enough of his calling.
I took him to be a man of about thirty. His
eyes were a dark blue, and full of good-humour
and intelligence; his hair was auburn,
curling and plentiful; no feature of him but
was admirable&mdash;nose, mouth, teeth&mdash;all combined
in a face of manly beauty. He stood
about five feet eleven, and, though there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
nothing of the soldier in his erect posture, his
figure was without any hint of that rounded
back and hanging-armed stoop which come
to people who&#8217;ve had to pull and haul on
a reeling deck for sour pork and creeping
bread in their youth.</p>

<p>These and like points I did not notice all
at once in that first glance; but before half
an hour was gone I could have drawn a
correct portrait of him from memory, so
often, at every maidenly and modest opportunity,
were my eyes upon him.</p>

<p>He had done business with uncle, and,
having lately arrived in the Thames, had
called and been asked to stay to supper and
meet me. They had been talking about my
cousin Will when I entered the room, and,
after the introduction, continued the subject,
my uncle seeming to be pretty full of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; said I, catching up something that
he had let fall. &#8216;So, then, you have settled
upon a ship for Will?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;and a fine ship
she is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no finer ship than the <i>Childe
Harold</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span> out of the Thames,&#8217; said Captain
Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;And her captain is a very good sort of a
man, we are told,&#8217; said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have heard him well spoken of. I
don&#8217;t know him,&#8217; said Captain Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;When does Will sail?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;A fortnight to-day,&#8217; answered my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;You remember our compact?&#8217; I said
eagerly.</p>

<p>My uncle smiled slowly and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8216;But I say yes!&#8217; I cried, starting up in
my impetuous way. &#8216;Aunt, <i>you</i> know it was
settled. Will was my playmate as a child.
I love him as a brother, and I claim the right
of giving him his outfit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She is a sailor&#8217;s child,&#8217; said my uncle to
Captain Butler.</p>

<p>They told me Will was out; he would
return before supper. In a short time I discovered
that Captain Butler had been two
years absent on a trading voyage in the
Pacific; that he was without a ship at present,
but was looking for the command of a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
barque of about six hundred and thirty tons,
called the <i>Arab Chief</i>, in which he was
thinking of purchasing a share. I admired
him so much that I could not help feeling
a sort of inquisitiveness, and asked him a
number of questions about his voyage and
the sea life. Indeed, I went further. I asked
him where he lived and if he had any
relatives. There was a boldness in me that
was bred of many years of independence and
of fearless indifference to people&#8217;s opinion.
I was by nature downright and off-hand, and
whenever I had a question to ask I asked it,
without ever troubling my head as to the
sort of taste I was exhibiting. All this might
have been partly owing to my lonely, independent
life; to my being unloved and
having nobody to love; to my having been
as much an orphan when my father died as
though I had lost my mother at the same
time.</p>

<p>And yet, though some of my own sex
may have turned up their noses at my plain,
bold questioning of Captain Butler, there is
no man, I vow, who would have disliked my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
manner in me. Captain Butler warmed up,
a fresh life came into his face with his frequent
laugh, and he could not take his eyes
off me. My uncle nursed his knee and
watched us with a composed countenance.
My aunt, who was a simple soul, followed the
conversation as one who hears and sees
nothing beyond what is said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Butler,&#8217; said my uncle, presently,
&#8216;ask Miss Marian why it is that she goes
on living in the East when she has fortune
enough to set up as a fine lady in the
West?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was born in Stepney,&#8217; said I. &#8216;My
house is there. My father and mother lie
buried there. I&#8217;ll not leave it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s the wit,&#8217; exclaimed Captain Butler,
&#8216;who says that the further he goes West, the
more convinced he is that the wise men came
from the East?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, what is a fine lady?&#8217; asked my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ask the dressmakers,&#8217; said Mr. Johnstone.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope my dear Marian will never change,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
said my aunt, looking fondly at me. &#8216;She is
fine enough, I am sure. If she goes West
she&#8217;ll be falling into company who&#8217;ll make her
ashamed of her poor East-end relatives.&#8217;</p>

<p>We rattled on in some such a fashion as
this. It was because I was not blind, and not
because I was vain, that I speedily saw that
Captain Butler admired me greatly. If I
stepped across the room, his eyes followed
the motions of my figure. If I spoke, his
gaze dwelt upon my lips. Even my poor,
dear, slow-eyed aunt noticed the impression I
had made, as I gathered from her occasional
looks at her husband. My uncle asked me to
sing, and I went to the piano and sang them
a simple, melodious sea-song which I used to
hear my father sing without an accompaniment.
My knowledge of music was slight,
but I had a correct ear and a strong voice,
and felt whatever I sang, because I chose to
sing only what I could feel, and my poor
attempts always pleased. Captain Butler
stood beside me at the piano while I sang;
he could not have praised me more warmly
had I been a leading lady at the Italian Opera.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
I got up, laughing, and told him that the
little music I had was by ear.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think I was never properly educated,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;My father hated schools and believed
that young girls thrown together made one
another wicked. I was educated by governesses,
and, really, to be able to read and write
and to know the multiplication-table is a
great deal to be thankful for.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My brother was right,&#8217; said my uncle.
&#8216;I hate girls&#8217; schools myself. Your finished
school-miss knows all about Shakespeare and
the musical classes, but she can&#8217;t tell how
many ounces go to a pound of beef.&#8217;</p>

<p>While we chatted, Mr. and Mrs. Lorrimer
were announced. Nobody expected them,
but they were welcome. Old Mr. Lorrimer
was a ship-chandler in a rather big way. He
was a vestige of the dead century, and,
saving the wig, went clothed almost exactly
as his father had. I see him now with his
frill, stockings, snuff-box, and the company
smirk that was in vogue when he was a boy.
He engaged my uncle in talk; my aunt and
Mrs. Lorrimer drew chairs together, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Captain Butler and I paired at a little distance
from the others.</p>

<p>I liked this man so much, I admired him
so greatly; I had fallen so much in love with
him, indeed, at the first sight of his handsome,
winning face, that I found myself talking as
freely as though we had known each other
for years. I told him that I lived with my
stepfather in the house that was my own, that
my life was as dull as a sermon, that I found
no pleasure in life outside my lonely rambles,
which I described to him. I thought he
looked grave when I told him I would be
away from my home for two or three nights
at a time.</p>

<p>&#8216;Every girl wants a mother,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;And a father,&#8217; said I; &#8216;but she can&#8217;t
keep them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why don&#8217;t you go a voyage?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have never thought of going a voyage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The world is a fine show,&#8217; said he. &#8216;It is
well worth seeing. You are rich, and should
see the world while you are young enough to
enjoy the sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have five hundred a year,&#8217; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>&#8216;You are rich, Miss Johnstone, nevertheless,&#8217;
said he; and his eyes made a very clear
allusion to my face and figure&mdash;a more intelligible
reference than had he spoken.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have a good mind to go a voyage,&#8217; said
I. &#8216;I am sick of my life, I assure you. I
hate my stepfather, and for all that I am rich,
as you call it, I am as much alone as if I had
been left to the parish. Oh, yes,&#8217; said I,
following his glance, &#8216;uncle and aunt are
dear to me and I love them, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; And I
lay back in my chair and yawned and
stretched out my arms.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come a voyage with me, Miss Johnstone,&#8217;
said he, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where to?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t tell you yet, but you shall hear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me hear and you shall have my
answer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know anything about the sea?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do I know anything about the sea?&#8217; I
echoed, with a loud, derisive laugh that
caused everybody to look at me. &#8216;I wonder
if you could ask me a question about the sea
which I couldn&#8217;t answer? Shall I put you a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
ship about? Explain what reefing topsails
means? Shall I wear ship for you? Shall I
snug you down a full-rigged ship, beginning
with the fore-royal-studding-sail?&#8217; And so I
went on.</p>

<p>He laughed continuously while I talked.
The others were now listening and laughing
too.</p>

<p>Just then my cousin, Will Johnstone, came
in, and I broke off my chat with Captain
Butler to greet the lad. Will was at this
time between fifteen and sixteen years of age.
He was a manly-looking boy, easy and gentlemanly,
fitter for the midshipman&#8217;s quarters of
a man-of-war than an apprentice&#8217;s berth on
board a merchantman. He had a look of my
father, and I loved him for that. He was
dressed in sea-going clothes, and though he
had never been farther than Ramsgate in all
his life, he carried his new calling so prettily,
there was such a pleasantly-acted swing in his
gait, you would have believed him fresh from
a voyage round the world. He came to me
eagerly when he had shaken hands with the
others, took Captain Butler&#8217;s chair, and told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
me with a glowing face about his ship, the
<i>Childe Harold</i>&mdash;what a fine ship she was, how
like a frigate she sat upon the water, how that
a fellow had told him she could easily reel out
twelve upon a bowline.</p>

<p>&#8216;She lies in the East India Docks. You
must come and see her, Marian. When will
you come? To-morrow&mdash;say to-morrow.&#8217;
Here he saw Captain Butler looking our way.
&#8216;Will you come, too, sir? Will you come
with my cousin?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come where?&#8217; said Captain Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come to the East India Docks to-morrow
to visit my ship, the <i>Childe Harold</i>?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;<i>My</i> ship!&#8221;&#8217; echoed my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;At what hour?&#8217; said Captain Butler.</p>

<p>Some talk went to this scheme; it was
presently settled that Will and Captain Butler
should dine at my house next day, and
afterward we should visit the <i>Childe Harold</i>.</p>

<p>This was the merriest evening I had ever
spent in my life. I sat at supper between
Captain Butler and Will, and had never felt
happier. My spirits were in a dance. I
laughed even at poor old Mr. Lorrimer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
jokes. After supper Captain Butler sang a
song, and I liked it so well that I begged him
to sing another. Then I sang. The old
people sat down to whist in a corner. Captain
Butler, Will, and I chatted, and so
slipped that evening away; till I was startled
on lifting my eyes to the clock to see that it
was almost eleven.</p>

<p>How should I get home? Should I walk
or drive? I stepped to the window and
parted the curtains and saw the stars shining.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is a fine night,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Will, give
me your company, and I&#8217;ll walk. I hate
your coaches.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Your way is my way, I believe,&#8217; said
Captain Butler. &#8216;May I accompany you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I went upstairs to put on my bonnet. My
aunt accompanied me. She lighted candles
beside a looking-glass, and I saw that my
cheeks were red and that my eyes shone like
diamonds.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe that you have made a conquest
to-night, my dear,&#8217; said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;A conquest has been made,&#8217; I answered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
&#8216;He is a very handsome fellow. And now
you shall tell me that he is married.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No more than you are.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Engaged to be married, then?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll not answer that. Sailors are sailors.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have thoroughly enjoyed myself,&#8217; said
I, kissing her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you think, my dear, that it is quite in
order you should ask Captain Butler to dine
with you to-morrow?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Quite in order, aunt. If I am not to do
what I like I will drown myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>But I kissed her again after I had said
this as an apology for the strength with which
I had spoken, and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Will and Captain Butler saw me to my
house. The streets were pretty full and
flaring. The night fine. I took Will&#8217;s arm,
and the three of us went along leisurely past
the Mint into Leman Street, and so into the
Commercial Road. No very romantic walk,
truly, though in this great world the woods
and groves of the poets are not the only
haunts of emotion. There is sentiment in the
East as well as in the West; and in what do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the passions of Whitechapel differ from those
of Tyburnia?</p>

<p>My maid was sitting up for me. Twelve
o&#8217;clock struck soon after I reached home, so
you will guess we had not hurried. For the
first time for many a long night I could not
sleep. I lay thinking all the time of Captain
Butler. I had fallen in love with him, and I
wondered at myself. No man that I had ever
before met had made the least impression
upon me. I knew my own heart well down
to this moment&mdash;I had never given men nor
their love a thought. In what, then, lay the
magic of this man? I was so much in love
with him that, had he stayed at my door
after Will Johnstone had gone away and
asked me to be his sweetheart and marry
him, I should have consented. I was distracted
with vexation and delight. All night
long I lay thinking of him, and if I slept in
snatches it was but to dream of him, so that,
whether I was awake or slept, he was present
to me. I felt that I must find out, and
quickly find out, if he had a sweetheart. If
so, why then I had not yet let go of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
reins; but I must make haste, or the bit
would be hard in the teeth and I should be
run away with.</p>

<p>I thought of his suggestion to go a voyage
with him, and pried close into it for an inner
meaning; but the memory of his manner
would not suffer me to find more than had
met my ear. To fall in love in an hour,
thought I! Well, it must run in the blood.
Father fell in love with mother at first sight;
that had been her fond memory&mdash;she had
boasted of it in his life and after his death&mdash;till,
to my grief and to the souring of the best
sweetness that her heart held, she swallowed
the mumping prescription whose plate was
upon my door, and whose lamp glowed like
a danger signal over the plate.</p>

<small>SHE VISITS THE &#8216;CHILDE HAROLD&#8217;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I rose</span> early next morning, sent for the cook,
and gave her certain instructions. The servants
in our strangely ordered home were as
much mine as my stepfather&#8217;s; I paid half
their wages. But my own maid was at my
own cost, and she waited upon me only.</p>

<p>Captain Butler and my cousin arrived
shortly after half-past twelve, and at one
o&#8217;clock we sat down to as dainty and elegant
a meal as I and the cook and my maid could
contrive among us. We drank champagne;
my father&#8217;s silver was upon the table; in the
middle was a rich hothouse nosegay, which
had cost me a guinea and a half. My maid,
a discreet, good-looking girl, waited admirably.
My cousin stared, and asked me, boy-like,
if I dined thus every day. I laughed
and answered: &#8216;Off as good dishes, Will, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
never so well, because I often dine alone
when I dine at home at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should like to dine with you every day,&#8217;
said Will.</p>

<p>I had dressed myself with extraordinary
care, but my eyes wanted the sparkle of the
previous evening, my cheeks the rose of those
merry hours. I wondered as I glanced at
Captain Butler whether the thought of me
had kept him awake all night. Somehow I
could not look at him with the confidence of
the previous evening. I felt shy; my eyes
stole to his face and dropped on detection;
my appetite was poor, and my laugh unnaturally
loud with nerve. His own manner
was a little constrained, and I saw, and my
heart throbbed and leaped when I saw, admiration
strong in his looks whenever he
regarded, or addressed, or listened to me.
Oh, thought I, what would I give now for
sauciness enough to ask you downright:
&#8216;Have you a sweetheart?&#8217;</p>

<p>During the course of the dinner I said to
him: &#8216;Don&#8217;t you think my way of living
strange?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>&#8216;Not at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You need a stepfather to understand my
unhappy state.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No very unhappy state, surely,&#8217; said he,
looking at the table, and then round the well-furnished
room.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think I shall go a voyage some of these
days, Will,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sail with me, Marian,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s your ship bound to?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sydney, New South Wales&mdash;a splendid
trip. Three months there, three months back,
three months to see the country in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And you give me a fortnight to make
up my mind!&#8217; said I, laughing. &#8216;Don&#8217;t they
send the convicts to Sydney? I can&#8217;t fancy
that country. &#8217;Tis seeing nothing to meet
one&#8217;s transported fellow-countrymen. There
are plenty of such folks walking past this
house at this minute. Who would leave
Stepney for Sydney?&#8217;</p>

<p>My cousin asked what trade the <i>Arab
Chief</i> would be in. Captain Butler answered
that he believed she was to trade to the West
Indies and eastern South American ports.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>&#8216;There&#8217;s a big world for you that way,
Marian,&#8217; said Will. &#8216;Down there the wind&#8217;s
full of bright parrots, every tree writhes with
monkeys. Robinson Crusoe lived all alone
somewhere in those parts, that&#8217;s if the great
river of Oroonoque&#8217;s where it was in Friday&#8217;s
time. The home of the great sea serpent is
in the Caribbean Sea, and if you kick up an
old stone by chance you stand to unearth a
mine of precious metal.&#8217;</p>

<p>I ended this by rising, and we soon afterwards
left the house. It was a clear, cold
afternoon, with a bright blue sky for London.
We took a coach to Limehouse and then a
boat. There is no change in the East India
Docks in all these years. I went down to
them for memory&#8217;s sake not very long ago,
and all was the same, it seemed to me, saving
the steamers. The basins were full of ships
of many sizes and of all rigs; the air was
radiant with the flicker and tremble of scores
of flags; strange smells of distant countries
loaded the atmosphere&mdash;sweet oils and spices,
wool and scarlet oranges and scented timber.
When I was a child my father had sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
brought me to these docks when he came to
them on business; I thought of him as I
looked, and felt a little girl again with the
odd wonderment and delight of a child in
me as I stared at the shipping and the
complicated heights of spar and rigging,
at the grinding cranes heavily lifting cargo
in and out, as I breathed the odours of the
littered quays, as I hearkened to the shouts,
to the songs of the seamen at the winch or
capstan, to the voices of the wind in the
gear, soft in the fabric of the taller ships
as the gay whistlings of silver pipes heard
afar.</p>

<p>We walked leisurely along the quays.
Will&#8217;s ship lay in a corner at a distance, and
he was for enthusiastically pressing forward
to arrive at her. His ardent pace kept him
ahead, and he often turned to invite us to
come on. But I was listening to Captain
Butler and was in no great hurry. At last
we came to Will&#8217;s ship, the <i>Childe Harold</i>.
Oh, my great God, when I think of it!
When I think of standing beside Captain
Butler and looking at that ship with my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
cousin at my elbow calling my attention to
points of her with a young sailor&#8217;s pride!</p>

<p>She was a very handsome vessel of her
kind, and a big ship according to the burden
of those days. Though she was receiving
cargo fast, her sides towered high above the
wall; she had been newly coppered, and her
metal glanced sunnily upon the soup-like
water she floated on. Captain Butler took
my hand, and we followed Will up the gangway
plank and gained the ship&#8217;s deck. A
man with a beard stood at the yawn of the
great main hatch; Will touched his cap and
whispered that he was the mate of the ship.
Captain Butler went up and shook hands with
him and rejoined us, saying that he had made
the man&#8217;s acquaintance at Callao. A quantity
of cases were being swung over the rail,
and as they were lowered down the hatch
I heard a noise of voices below&mdash;calls and
yells, and the kind of language you expect to
hear arising from the hold of a ship that is
populous with lumpers. Will took us into
the cuddy, which you will now call the
saloon; a fine cabin under the poop-deck,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
with some sleeping berths on either hand.
He then walked us forward to show us the
apprentices&#8217; quarters.</p>

<p>The ship had what is known as a topgallant
forecastle, on either hand of which
was a wing of cabin, a sort of deck-house,
entered by a door that slid in grooves. The
apprentices lived in the wing on the left,
or port, or larboard side, as the expression
then was.</p>

<p>&#8216;How many of you are there?&#8217; asked
Captain Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;Three,&#8217; answered my cousin.</p>

<p>The place was empty, and I entered it and
looked about me to gather whether there
was anything I could purchase to render the
coarse, rude abode a little more hospitable to
the sight.</p>

<p>&#8216;This won&#8217;t be like being at home, Will?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It will be seeing life, though, and starting
on a career,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;These are very snug quarters,&#8217; said
Captain Butler. &#8216;What sort of a forecastle
have you, Johnstone?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>My cousin led us into a large, wooden
cave. It was very gloomy here. We had to
lift our feet high to enter the door. The
huge windlass stood, a great mass of reddened
timber and grinning ironwork, in front of the
entrance to this forecastle; abaft it rose the
trunk of the foremast, and behind, again, the
solid square of the galley, or kitchen; the
thick shrouds descended on both sides; and,
though it was a bright day, the shadows of
these things lay in a twilight upon the forecastle
entrance, and I needed to stand awhile
and accustom my eyes to the gloom before I
could see.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is a fine forecastle,&#8217; said Captain
Butler. &#8216;Few crews get better parlours.&#8217;</p>

<p>The interior was empty. Rows of bunks
on both sides ran ghostly in the obscurity of
the bows.</p>

<p>&#8216;What hatch is this?&#8217; said I, pointing to
a small, covered square in the deck close to
where I stood.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;ll be the way to the fore-peak,&#8217; said
Captain Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of a place is that?&#8217; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>&#8216;The rats&#8217; nursery,&#8217; he answered, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you been into it, Will?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;No. They keep coal and broom-handles
there; odds and ends of stores, cans of oil,
and everything that&#8217;s unpleasant. I find
things out by asking.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Right, Johnstone,&#8217; said Captain Butler.
&#8216;Keep on asking on board ship. That&#8217;s the
way to learn. How would you like to be an
able seaman, Miss Johnstone, and sail before
the mast and sleep in a place like this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This would not be my end of the ship if
I were a man,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>We wandered aft on to the poop, whence
we could command a view of the whole ship;
and here we stood looking at the clamorous,
gallant scene round about us, till the sun
sank low across the river beyond Rotherhithe,
and the shadow of the evening deepened the
colours of the streaming flags, and hung a
rusty mist out upon the farther reaches of
the river, making the ships there loom dusky
and swollen.</p>

<p>Captain Butler asked us if we would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
drink tea with him at the Brunswick Hotel.
I was now liking nothing better in the world
than his company, and gladly accepted, and
the three of us walked to the hotel and took
a seat at a table in a window, where we had
a view of the shipping; and here we drank
tea and ate some small, sweet white-fish and
passed a happy hour.</p>

<p>Captain Butler must have been less than a
man, and without eyes in his head, if he had
not by this time guessed that I was very
much in love with him. I was sure he
admired me; indeed, his admiration was unfeigned.
I had never been loved by a man,
and could not guess what was in the mind of
this handsome sailor by merely observing the
admiration that softened and sweetened the
naturally gay and careless expression of his
eyes, but it filled me with sweet delight to
know that he admired me. This was a full,
rich cup for my lips for a <i>first</i> draught. I
liked to feel that he watched me. I&#8217;d turn
my head a little way and talk to Will, and
continue talking that Captain Butler might
go on looking at me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>&#8216;I wish you were not sailing so soon,
cousin,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I&#8217;d plan more of these excursions.
They make me forget I have a
stepfather.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope your stepfather does not ill-treat
you!&#8217; exclaimed Captain Butler, and some
glow came into his face.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no!&#8217; cried I, and I guessed that my
eyes sparkled with a sudden heat of my
spirits. &#8216;Ill-treat me, indeed! The fact is
the house isn&#8217;t big enough for him and me.
But I won&#8217;t turn him out. He&#8217;s the father of
my mother&#8217;s child, and my home was my
mother&#8217;s. But oh, I feel the gloom of it! I
am alone. I <i>can&#8217;t</i> take to the little one. And
must it be year after year the same?&#8217; I cast
my eyes down and breathed quickly; then,
rounding upon Will, I cried with a loud silly
laugh, &#8216;You shall take me on a voyage with you
when you come home!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I like these excursions,&#8217; said Will. &#8216;Don&#8217;t
you, Captain Butler?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d like them better if they didn&#8217;t end so
soon,&#8217; he answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8216;I have a fortnight!&#8217; exclaimed Will.
&#8216;Let&#8217;s go on a trip every day!&#8217;</p>

<p>Captain Butler&#8217;s eyes met mine.</p>

<p>&#8216;You, of course, have something better to
do?&#8217; said I to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have nothing to do.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s your ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have no ship,&#8217; said he. &#8216;A barque,
called the <i>Arab Chief</i>, is in course of completion
at Sunderland. I may command her
if I invest in her. I wish to consider. I am
not rich, and I must see my way clearly
before I venture all that I have.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So you must. And I suppose you&#8217;ll go
and live at Sunderland?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. I can do no good at Sunderland.
Time enough to go to Sunderland when the
ship is ready. She&#8217;s not building under my
superintendence.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll visit your relatives in the
country?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have relatives, but they don&#8217;t live in
the country, and I shan&#8217;t visit them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t we arrange for some more trips?&#8217;
said Will. &#8216;Let&#8217;s go sight-seeing every day.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>&#8216;Give us a sketch of your fancies, Johnstone,&#8217;
said Captain Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; he began, counting upon his
fingers, &#8216;there&#8217;s a dinner at the Star and
Garter; that&#8217;s good sight-seeing number one.
Then there&#8217;s Greenwich yonder, and another
dinner, number two. Then, what say you to
Woolwich and a peep at the hulks? Call
that job a day on the river, taking a boat at
Billingsgate or the Tower. Number three.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Keep in shore, my lad,&#8217; said Captain Butler,
laughing. &#8216;You&#8217;ll be having enough of
the water soon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do ye say to Hampstead and tea?
Then a dinner at the King&#8217;s Arms at Hampton
Court? And is Windsor too far off?&#8217; So he
rattled.</p>

<p>Yet the jolly young fellow&#8217;s proposals were
very well to our liking, and before we rose to
depart from the Brunswick Hotel we had
schemed out a long holiday week. They saw
me to my house, as on the previous night.
Neither would come in. When they had left
me, I felt very dull and lonely. I found a
note on my table from a friend at Bow. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
asked me to a card-party next night, but I
was in no humour to accept any invitations to
houses where I was not likely to meet Captain
Butler. Indeed, I had come home from this
jaunt to the docks as deeply in love as ever
woman was with a man in this world. I
slept, it is true, but I dreamed of nothing but
my handsome sailor, as my heart was already
secretly calling him. I went to sea with him
in a number of visions that night, quelled a
mutiny among the sailors, saved Captain
Butler&#8217;s life at the risk of my own; and when
he took me in his arms to thank and caress
me, I looked in his face, and heavens!&mdash;it was
my stepfather!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>SHE IS ASKED IN MARRIAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the appointed time I was at my aunt&#8217;s
next morning. Captain Butler and Will were
there. We went to Richmond, and after we
had arrived it rained for the rest of the day,
but it was all one to me; indeed, I would
rather have had it rain than sunshine, for it
forced us to sit indoors, whilst Will, defying
the rain, went out and left Captain Butler and
me alone, which was just what I liked.</p>

<p>I will not catalogue these holiday trips;
they made me feel as if I were living for the
first time in all my life; they made me know
that I was a girl with passions and tastes, yet
easy to delight. I will not say that I enjoyed
my liberty, because for years I had not known
what restraint was; but I was sensible that
my being able to go where I pleased and to
do what I pleased was a prodigious privilege<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
at this time, when I had lost my heart, and
must have gone mad had I been withheld
from the society of the man who had it.</p>

<p>Two days before Will sailed my aunt
called upon me. Our holiday rambles had
run out; that day was to be blank, and I was
not to see Captain Butler again until Thursday&mdash;it
was a Thursday, I remember&mdash;when
we were going down to the docks to see Will
off. I remarked a peculiar look in my aunt&#8217;s
face, which prompted me, in my impetuous
way, to say:</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s brought you here? What have
you come to tell me? Now don&#8217;t keep me
waiting?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lor&#8217;, my dear, one would need the breath
of a healthy giant to keep pace with your
impatience. Give me leave to rest a minute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All&#8217;s well at home, I hope?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yes, of course, as well as it can be
with a mother and father whose only child is
leaving them, perhaps for ever, in a couple of
days.&#8217; Her eyes moistened. &#8216;But it is his
wish, and it is his father&#8217;s wish, and that must
make it right&mdash;yes, that must make it right;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
though I&#8217;d have been grateful, very grateful,
if it hadn&#8217;t been the sea.&#8217; She wept for a few
minutes, and I held my peace. Then drying
her eyes with a resolved motion of the handkerchief,
she said: &#8216;You&#8217;ve been enjoying
some lively days of late, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Happy days. Poor Will!&#8217; and now I
felt as if I must cry, too.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re a strange creature, my dear.
Whatever you do seems to me wrong. And
yet, somehow, I can never satisfy my mind
that your conduct&#8217;s improper. I believe you&#8217;d
be the same were your mother living. Your
father might have held you in, but you&#8217;d have
had your way with your poor mother.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What have I done?&#8217; said I, bridling up
and flushing in the face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing out of the ordinary,&#8217; she
answered mildly. &#8216;Of course, your going
about so much with Captain Butler, often
being alone with him, as Will has told us, is
quite contrary to my ideas of good conduct.
Do you want the man for a husband, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>I guessed by my temper that I looked
hotly at her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>&#8216;Do you, child, do you? You should
answer me. If you do not answer me I will
go, and I am sure that you will wish this
house should be burnt down rather than that
I should go.&#8217;</p>

<p>My temper went with this, and with it the
blood out of my face.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you want me to say, aunt?&#8217; I
exclaimed in a faint voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you be content to marry Captain
Butler?&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked down upon the ground and said
softly:</p>

<p>&#8216;I love him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He loves you. Do you know that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He has not told me so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is a man of very gentlemanlike feelings,
far above the average merchant sea-captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t I know it!&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, he loves you, and would be very
glad to marry you. And I dare say he would,&#8217;
said my aunt, looking up and down my figure
and then round the room, &#8216;but he&#8217;ll not offer
marriage unless he is certain you&#8217;ll accept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
him. He spent last evening with us, and had
a very long and serious talk with your uncle
and me on the subject. He declines to
recognise your stepfather, which is quite
proper under the circumstances, and regards
me and your uncle as taking the place of your
parents. Now, my dear, he is very much in
love with you, and his diffidence comes from
your being well off. We had a very long and
serious talk, and I am here to have a serious
talk with you, if not a long one.&#8217;</p>

<p>I felt that my face was lighted up; I saw
the reflection of its delight in her own placid
expression. My heart bounded; I could have
danced and sung and waltzed about the room.
I sat down, locking my hands tightly upon my
lap, and listened with all the composure I
could summon.</p>

<p>She informed me that Captain Butler had
been exceedingly candid, had exactly named
his savings and his patrimony, which scarcely
amounted to three thousand pounds, and that
he was deliberating whether or not to invest
all that he had in a share of the new barque,
<i>Arab Chief</i>. Mr. Johnstone had advised him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
supposing he should be so fortunate as to
gain my consent to marry him, not to make
me his wife until he had gone his first voyage
and seen how his venture fell out.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your uncle,&#8217; said my aunt, &#8216;is strongly
of opinion that a man has no business to go
and marry a fine handsome young woman
like you, then leave her after a week or a
month, and not set eyes on her again till he
returns home from round the world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish my uncle would mind his own
business,&#8217; said I, pouting, and feeling my face
very long.</p>

<p>But my aunt insisted that my uncle was
right. She added that Captain Butler cordially
agreed with him. Captain Butler&#8217;s
own wish was to betroth himself to me, then
to make his voyage; then return and marry
me and carry me away with him to sea.</p>

<p>My eyes sparkled, and I jumped up and
walked the room greatly excited. But after
this my aunt grew tedious. Was it imaginable
that any sort of love fit to base so solemn
an affair as marriage upon could exist between
two people who had known each other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
a fortnight only? Here was I joyously
avowing my love for Captain Butler and expressing
the utmost eagerness to marry him.
Did I know what I was talking about? Had
I given a moment&#8217;s reflection to what marrying
a sailor signified? I was rich, young, and
handsome; I had a fine house of my own; I
had liberty and health; I was without children
to tease me, to pale me with midnight
watchings, to burden my spirits with anxiety
for their future. Should I not be giving
myself away very cheaply by marrying a sea-captain,
a respectable, good-looking man
certainly, but poor, following a calling in
which no one can make any sort of figure, an
underpaid, perilous, beggarly vocation? She
did not deny that Captain Butler came from
a highly respectable stock. He had mentioned
two members of his family whom Mr.
Johnstone perfectly well knew by name. His
father had been in the Royal Navy and had
served under Collingwood and Lord Exmouth
and had died a poor lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, he&#8217;s a gentleman by birth,&#8217; said my
aunt, &#8216;and superior to his position. There&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
his calling, out of which, to be sure, he can
get a living, so as to be independent of his
wife, which must always be the first consideration
with every man of spirit. And, then,
you have plenty of money for both, and for
as many as may come, should ever he find
himself out of employment. But what do
you know of each other? How can you tell
that you will be able to live happily together?
What! In a fortnight? Ridiculous! Why,
I have lived one-and-twenty years with your
uncle, and we don&#8217;t even yet understand each
other. You have by no means a sweet temper.
But what time do you give the poor fellow to
find you out in? And he may be quite a
fiend himself, for all you know. It needs not
much wig to hide a pair of horns. A tail
will lie curled up out of sight under a fashionable
coat, and your cloven hoof fits any shoe,
my dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>So she chatted and teased and worried me
with her advice and old-fashioned precepts.
And then she angered me, and we quarrelled
awhile, and afterwards cried and kissed.
However, when her visit was ended, I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
promised her, in answer to her earnest, almost
tearful entreaty, that, though I should consent
to engage myself to Captain Butler, I would
not marry him until he had returned from his
next voyage, which, if he went to the West
Indies and South America, would not keep
him very long away from me, so that I should
have plenty of time to judge of his character
whilst he was ashore and abundance of leisure
afterward to reflect upon my observations
and prepare myself for the very greatest
change that can befall a woman.</p>

<p>I did not see Captain Butler again until
Thursday. In the brief interval I had made
up my mind to accept him at once if he
proposed. Oh, my few days of holiday association
with him had filled my heart with a
passion of love! Not my happiness only&mdash;my
very life was in his power.</p>

<p>I went to my uncle&#8217;s house on Thursday,
early in the morning. We were to see poor
Will off. We all tried to put on a cheerful
air, and Will talked big of the presents he
would bring home for his mother and me;
but his mother&#8217;s eyes were red with a night<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of secret weeping; and whenever the lad&#8217;s
sight went to her face his mouth twitched
and, if he was speaking, his voice trembled
and broke. His father looked often at him.</p>

<p>Captain Butler met us at the docks. I
guessed he witnessed in my looks that my
aunt had spoken to me. He gazed at me
fondly as he held my hand, but there was
nothing of significance to be said between us
at this time of sorrowful leave-taking. We
went on board with Will. When I kissed the
dear fellow, I broke down and wept; and
then Mr. Johnstone led the way to the
Brunswick Hotel, and we went upstairs to a
room which commanded a view of the ship,
and sat at a window watching her as she
hauled out of dock.</p>

<p>By the time the ship had been towed out
of sight past Greenwich Reach, it was hard
upon one o&#8217;clock. My uncle had ordered
some sandwiches and sherry as an excuse for
us to sit and watch the ship. This was no
entertainment for me, who had not partaken
of it, indeed, and who had breakfasted but
lightly early that morning. My uncle called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
for the bill, and then rose to go. He told
us he had an appointment which he would
have barely time to keep. My aunt said
to me:</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you going to do?&#8217; I returned
no answer, for I had not made up my mind.
&#8216;Come home with me, dear,&#8217; said my aunt,
&#8216;and dine with us at half-past two.&#8217;</p>

<p>I did not care to go home with her; first,
because I felt T should be losing sight of
Captain Butler, and, next, because they were
full of grief for the departure of their son;
so that my presence would be a sort of impertinence,
whilst, again, I could not at all relish
the prospect of a long and melancholy afternoon
and evening spent in the neighbourhood
of the Tower. So, after reflecting a minute
or two, I said:</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll not go home with you, aunt. I&#8217;ll dine
here and then take rail to Fenchurch Street
and make my way to Hyde Park. A brisk
walk will do me good. I feel as though I
had lost a brother.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t stop,&#8217; said my uncle, beginning to
bustle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>My aunt saw how it was, and looked at
me reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8216;I must return with your uncle,&#8217; said she.
&#8216;Are you to be left alone here? But what if
you are? Your being alone about London
and the neighbourhood is quite too much a
habit with you, Marian&mdash;a practice I can&#8217;t
approve. Which way do you go?&#8217; she continued,
looking at Captain Butler.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll remain with Miss Johnstone, if she
will suffer me to do so,&#8217; he replied.</p>

<p>I smiled and coloured and bowed to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can stop no longer,&#8217; said my uncle,
pulling out a great watch.</p>

<p>My aunt looked &#8216;hung in the wind,&#8217; to
use the phrase of the sailor, as though she
understood she ought not to leave me alone
with Captain Butler; but she correctly
guessed that I did not want her; indeed, her
remaining would have made me angry, and
no doubt my fear of her intentions showed in
my face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said she, &#8216;I could not leave you in
better hands. Captain Butler will carefully
look after you, I am sure.&#8217; And she went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
quickly after her husband, who would wait
for her no longer.</p>

<p>Captain Butler rang the bell and ordered
some dinner. I was to be his guest, he said.</p>

<p>&#8216;But why, Miss Johnstone, do you wish to
go all the way to Hyde Park?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is no wish. I&#8217;ll go wherever you
please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We are close to Greenwich here. Shall
we take a turn about Greenwich Park presently?
The days are still short, and you are
not so far from your house at Greenwich as
you would be at Kensington.&#8217;</p>

<p>I consented, and then we stood at the
window, looking at the scene of the river
from the docks, talking about Will and the
sea-life and such matters until dinner was
ready. I longed to hear him say that he
loved me. The language of his eye was not
satisfying enough. I wanted him to take my
hand and ask me to be his wife. I had
thought my appetite good until I sat down,
and then I could not eat. My heart beat
fast. I felt my colour come and go. I was
alone with the man that I loved. I seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to have lost my self-control, and behaved like
a shy school-girl, and there were moments
when I could have wished my aunt had not
left us.</p>

<p>The waiter was slow, and it was nearly
three o&#8217;clock before we rose. Captain Butler
went to the window, looked out, and said to
me: &#8216;I am afraid this fine day is not going
to last. There&#8217;s a thickness gathering upon
the river, and the sun looks like the rising
moon. The afternoons are still short. Shall
we hold Greenwich Park over for another
day?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you like.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How amiable you are! You give me
my way in everything.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What shall we do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Stop here for a little while, if you don&#8217;t
mind. We have this room to ourselves for
the present.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took me by the hand. I trembled
and sat down, and he seated himself beside
me. Am I to repeat what he said&mdash;in what
words he told me how great his love was for
me&mdash;in what terms he asked me to be his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
wife? All this I could unfold, ancient as it
is in my memory. I could give it to you as
though it were of yesterday&#8217;s happening.
But the black curtain still remains down on
the memorable, the horrible, the tragical
scene it is to rise upon soon, and I must not
linger over such recollections as I am now
dictating to my friend.</p>

<p>It was quite in keeping that I, a sailor&#8217;s
daughter, should be wooed and asked in
marriage by a sailor in scenes full of shipping,
within hearing of the cries and choruses of
seamen and the hundred noises of the busy
docks. A red mist lay upon the river, and
the sun hung pale and rayless, like a great
lemon, in the west. We were occupying a
room that might have been the coffee-room.
Several tables were draped and ready for
guests, but we had been alone when my
uncle and aunt left us, and we remained
alone. He held me to him and kissed me;
he looked proudly and gratefully at me and
said that he loved me from the moment he
had set eyes on me; that he thought me the
handsomest woman he had ever seen in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
life; that he adored me for my spirit&mdash;much
more to this effect he said. But he told me
he never would have had the heart to offer
for my hand if he had not found some encouragement
in my looks. Then he went
over the long talk he&#8217;d had about me with
Mr. and Mrs. Johnstone.</p>

<p>&#8216;They begged,&#8217; said he, &#8216;if you accepted
me that we should not be married until my
return from my next voyage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They are dear to me,&#8217; said I, looking at
him, &#8216;but they are not my guardians, and
have no control over me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But they may be right, Marian, and
they have a claim upon you too. I hope to
do well next trip. I believe I shall do well
enough,&#8217; said he, smiling and smoothing the
back of my hand, &#8216;to enable me to put
something to your own fortune. I wish to
be independent of you. You are not a
woman to respect a man that is dependent
upon you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My aunt was right,&#8217; said I. &#8216;We don&#8217;t
understand each other yet. Certainly you
don&#8217;t understand me.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>He kissed me and said he knew what was
in my mind, but all the same when he was
my husband he wished to be independent of
my fortune.</p>

<p>&#8216;You shall have it all,&#8217; I exclaimed, &#8216;and
that will make you independent of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; said he gravely, &#8216;now that you
have consented to be my wife I&#8217;ll tell you
what I schemed; there would seem something
unnatural in my going to sea and leaving my
young bride behind me. I want you to be
at my side when you are my wife. I do not
know that I shall follow the sea much
longer! A great deal will depend upon the
issue of my next voyage. If I leave you
behind, betrothed to me, you will have plenty
of time to consider whether you, as a beauty
and a fortune, have done wisely in accepting
the hand of a plain merchant captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense, Tom,&#8217; said I, giving
his name bluntly, and not at all relishing his
sentimental fastidiousness, which I attributed
to the influence of my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear girl, when we are married, we
mean to live together happily, don&#8217;t we?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>&#8216;That will depend upon you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It will depend upon us both, Marian.
When a sailor carries a ship into unnavigated
waters, if he is a good sailor, and does not
mean to cast his ship away, he heaves the
lead as he goes, warily sounds along every
fathom of his road until he brings up in a
safe anchorage. This is what you must do,
and it&#8217;s for me to give you time to heave the
lead, dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You want time to heave it yourself,
Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My darling,&#8217; he cried, catching me to
him, &#8216;I would marry you to-morrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>Presently, when we had composed ourselves,
he said that he was going down to
Sunderland next week, and would be away
for about a week; and then he talked to me
about purchasing a share in the new vessel,
and seemed to want my advice. He named
several instances of merchants who, having
speculated in this way in shipping, had risen
out of small beginnings into great opulence.
He told me that he would be better off than
most investors, inasmuch as he would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
command of his own venture, so to speak, be
able to control things and push his business
to the limits of all successful directions.</p>

<p>In this sort of conversation the afternoon
passed away. At last, at about five o&#8217;clock,
we were interrupted by a party of captains
and others coming in to dine, on which Tom
paid the bill and we left. He accompanied
me to my house, and bade me farewell at the
door, after arranging to call for me at eleven
o&#8217;clock next morning.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>SHE PARTS WITH HER SWEETHEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Well,</span> on the following week, my sweetheart
went to Sunderland, and I felt as widowed as
though I had been his wife and he had died.
He crossed from Sunderland to Liverpool, and
was absent a fortnight. From Liverpool he
wrote to tell me that he was very well satisfied
with the <i>Arab Chief</i>, and had agreed with
her owners, who did business in Liverpool,
to take command of her and purchase a share
to the value of three thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The influence of his love was very strong
upon me while he was away. He had hinted,
but gently, that he thought my aunt right in
objecting to my old love of rambling&mdash;I mean
to the excursions I used to make down the
river and to other parts, often sleeping out
for a night or two at a time, as you have
heard; and during his absence I went nowhere,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
save to my aunt&#8217;s or to the houses of
some of my particular friends.</p>

<p>Meanwhile you will not suppose that I saw
nothing of Mr. Stanford. We lived in the
same house, and were, therefore, bound to
meet, not, indeed, in our separate apartments,
but upon the staircase or in the passages.
When Tom had been gone about a week, my
stepfather knocked upon my door one morning
as I sat at breakfast. I bade him enter,
and he sat down at the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;I met Mrs. Johnstone yesterday,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;and she gave me a piece of news. Allow me
to congratulate you,&#8217; and he inclined his head.</p>

<p>I bowed slightly in return, keeping silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am aware that I have no claim upon
you, Miss Johnstone,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;None whatever,&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;But I am your stepfather, and, as a
matter of courtesy, not to say more, you
should, I think, have favoured me from your
own lips with the news of your engagement.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My affairs have nothing to do with you,
Mr. Stanford.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Miss Marian, I am not here to quarrel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
but to congratulate you,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Our
relations have long been uncomfortable. I
should have quitted this house some time ago,
but for the difficulty I find in meeting with
one equally suitable. My practice is of the
utmost importance to me not for my sake
only; it is my duty to make a provision for
your mother&#8217;s child.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She is your child!&#8217; I cried, hotly.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not need to be told that, Miss
Marian. It is very painful to me to reflect
that your antipathy should have no other
basis than your lamented mother&#8217;s love for
me. Your mother, I hope and trust, was
dear to you, Miss Marian, and it is most
regrettable that there is nothing in her
memory to soften your violent prejudice.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I beg you will not speak to me of my
mother.&#8217;</p>

<p>He eyed me askant; he had a way of
looking at you with his head half turned.
&#8216;I am here primarily to congratulate you,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;It is your pleasure to be reticent,
and I will therefore not trouble you with any
questions about your <i>fianc&eacute;</i>. But one inquiry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
you will forgive&mdash;it is a matter of business.
When, pray, are you to be married?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You will probably settle in this house
with your husband?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When he is my husband he shall live
where he pleases, and I&#8217;ll live with him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This end of London is not to everybody&#8217;s
taste,&#8217; he said, with an acid smile. &#8216;It has
occurred to me that your husband might wish
to live in the west of the town. If so, I should
be glad to arrange with him or with you to
take this house off your hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>I answered coldly that I had no intention
of parting with the house. It had belonged
to my father, and whatever belonged to my
father I held in veneration; and this I said
with so much bitterness that he rose, without
another word, and left the room. I was glad
to see his back. I cannot tell you how I
hated the man.</p>

<p>Tom returned at about the expiration of a
fortnight, and now I was one of the happiest of
women. We were together day after day.
We visited many old-fashioned resorts in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
neighbourhood of London, not one of which
is probably now in existence. His influence
did me a world of good. It was the most
shaping, elevating, I had almost said, ennobling
influence any girl could have come
under. The power of his love over me was a
godsend to such a character as mine. I had
lived so uncontrolled a life, I was by nature
so defiant, quick-tempered, and contemptuous
of the opinion of others, that in many directions
I did not really know the right thing
to do. No mother could have more wisely
directed her child than Tom governed me.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are a rich garden,&#8217; he would say,
&#8216;but overrun; the sweets are too crowded,
Marian, and here and there, my love, is a bit
of snake-like habit that needs to be uncoiled
from the beautiful plant it has got foul of.&#8217;</p>

<p>I well remember, soon after he returned
from Liverpool, that he saw me to my house.
It was six o&#8217;clock in the evening. I asked
him to walk in.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, dear,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;No, dear!&#8221; Why not, Tom? You
are tired and I am alone. Come in.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>&#8216;It is because you are alone that I will
not come in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am always alone here,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I live
alone. You know that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I know that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And I am never to see you at my house
because I am alone!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dearest, I will fetch you to-morrow at
eleven, and then we can have a talk on the
subject of men&#8217;s visits to their sweethearts
who live alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>He pressed my hand and left me.</p>

<p>Next day he talked to me as he had promised.
I listened with love and interest,
though I secretly thought it no more than
a sort of hair-splitting on the part of society
to insist that a girl should not receive her
sweetheart alone in her own house. I was
alone with Tom now. I had been alone with
him at the Brunswick Hotel. What was the
difference between my being alone in the
streets with him and my being with him at
my rooms at home? Yet he said there was a
difference, and, of course, he was right. I
listened to him deferentially, with my head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
hung. Had it been my aunt who uttered the
opinions he delivered, I should have argued
with her, flashed my most spirited looks upon
her, flung from her, and, had it been possible,
proved myself right by doing the very thing
which she declared the world thought improper.</p>

<p>Friends who had known me earlier would
have believed that love had taken the spirit
out of me; but the truth was in Tom I had
found my master. We were constantly together.
Scarcely a day passed whilst he was
in London without our meeting. I made him
sit to a painter of miniature portraits in
Regent Street, and the same artist took my
likeness for my sweetheart to carry away to
sea with him. They were both beautiful
little pictures. My eyes seemed to glow out
of the ivory, and Tom&#8217;s face was to the life,
happy, careless, loving.</p>

<p>It was settled by this time that we were to
be married on his return. He hoped that he
might not have to go to sea again after next
voyage. If he went, he would take me with
him. The scheme provided for my being at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
his side, as his wife, in any case. But he
owned that, though he had recommended
a sea voyage to me, and though he had said
he would take me as his wife to sea with him,
he had far rather that I kept on dry ground.
The sea was no place for woman. It was
hurdled with perils. It was a ceaseless jump
of risks from one port to another. Here,
then, was one reason for our not being
married until he returned.</p>

<p>But another and more controlling one,
though he never betrayed it in words, was
his desire that I should have plenty of leisure
to reflect upon the step I had consented to
take. I could not now but see things as he
did, and, indeed, I hope I could never have
been so unmaidenly as to give the smallest
expression to my secret wishes; but in my
heart of hearts I was more vexed than I can
express by this delay, which I attributed
largely to my uncle&#8217;s influence with Tom.
When two people are in love, and are to be
married, there will be impatience. Whether
the man or the woman is or should be the
more impatient, I don&#8217;t know. I own that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
deep in my heart I was bitterly impatient.
Tom would not sail till August; we had
plenty of time to get married in; several
months must pass before he could return,
and, like a child, I wanted my toy at once.
I wanted to feel that he belonged to me; that,
though he was absent, an invisible bond
united us. I was jealous of him. I said to
myself: At the place he is sailing to he may
meet with some woman whom he will think
fairer and discover to be richer than I. Are
not sailors faithless? All the songs and
stories about them represent them so. Then
I thought of my father, and abhorred myself
for being visited with such thoughts, and
cried like a fool to think how mean was my
heart, that loving, nay, I may say adoring my
Tom as I did, I could yet suppose when out
of sight he would forget me.</p>

<p>Well, the time came round when the <i>Arab
Chief</i> was nearly ready, and when my sweetheart
must go to Sunderland to carry her to
the Mersey, there to load for Rio Janeiro. I
never could understand business, least of all
the business of the sea, and would listen to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
him whilst he talked about his venture, vainly
endeavouring to grasp his meaning in the
full. But I gathered from his conversations
with my uncle that he was very sanguine,
and that, in any case, there could be no
risks, as he had taken care to insure considerably
in excess of his stake. I recollect,
on one occasion, when we were dining
at my aunt&#8217;s, my uncle, in talking with Tom
about his venture, suggested that he erred
by insuring so high above the value of the
risk.</p>

<p>&#8216;But why?&#8217; said Tom. &#8216;At all events, I
pay handsomely for the privilege of protecting
myself up to the hilt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True,&#8217; said the lawyer, &#8216;but always in
case of loss there is something in over-insurance
that vitiates&mdash;perhaps to one&#8217;s prejudice
only, mind&mdash;the well-seeming of this
act of self-protection.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The underwriters have it in their power
to satisfy themselves,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are your firms?&#8217; asked my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Marine, the Alliance, and the General
Maritime Insurance.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>&#8216;That&#8217;s cover enough, captain,&#8217; said my
uncle, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, and I mean to go to the Neptune
for a policy on the freight. I have a considerable
share in the barque, and I intend
that my proportion of the freight shall be
safe. I am not of those who believe in keeping
their money in a purse; I carry mine in
my pockets. If the purse is lost, all is gone.
Who&#8217;s to assure me of the solvency of an
insurance office? I mean that this voyage
shall enable me to stay at home with my wife,&#8217;
said he, looking fondly at me. &#8216;Let another
take charge of the barque next time. I&#8217;ll
make enough to own the half of her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You shall own all of her, if you will,
Tom,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s as your trustees shall decide,&#8217; said
my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;My money is my own, and I shall do
what I please with it,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; and with your knowledge of business,
Marian, you shall go into partnership
with your husband as a shipowner and land
the firm in the Fleet.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>Here Tom sang:</p>

<p class="center">&#8216;All in the Downs the Fleet lay moored,&#8217;</p>

<p>and so with a laugh changed the subject.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of the month of
August when my sweetheart bade me farewell
on his departure to Liverpool to take command
of the <i>Arab Chief</i>. I had passionately
desired to go with him; but my aunt could
not accompany me, and I was without a
friend of my own sex able just then to leave
home. My wish was overruled by my uncle
and aunt. Tom himself did not favour it,
though his longing for me to be with him to
the last was as keen as mine, and so I took
my farewell of him in my uncle&#8217;s home. He
held me in his arms whilst I cried till I
thought my heart would break. He kissed
me again and again, bade me keep up my
spirits, to consider that that day a year I
should have been his wife some months. He
begged me to remain faithful to him, and
told me there never would be a minute when
I should be out of his thoughts; and solemnly
asking God to look down upon me, to guard
me against all evil and sickness, to look down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
upon him, to protect and bring him back in
safety to me, he pressed a last lingering kiss
upon my lips and left me alone with my tears
and my memories.</p>

<p>I received several letters from him whilst
he was at Liverpool. He wrote in good
spirits, called his ship a beauty, and said that
of her kind she was the most admired of
anything that had been seen in the Mersey
for years. There was but one drawback.
The mate of the barque was a Mr. Samuel
Rotch. Tom had met this man some five or
six years before in South America, and had
had an unpleasantness with him there. He
did not tell me what that trouble was. Afterwards
Rotch had served under him, and there
was a further difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. Rotch, he said, was a man of his own
age, soured by professional disappointments,
but a shrewd, intelligent person, and an excellent
seaman. He had rather that the
owners had appointed any other man as mate.
But he believed that there was some sort of
distant relationship between Rotch and one
of the firm; and as the man had once before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
got into trouble in consequence of his representations,
and was poor, with a wife and two
children to support, he had resolved to leave
matters as he found them.</p>

<p>I showed this letter to my uncle, and
asked him if he thought that Mr. Rotch had
it in his power to make Tom unhappy or the
voyage uncomfortable. He laughed, and
answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;Your Tom will have gone to sea with
irons and bilboes, depend on &#8217;t. Do you
know that the power of the shipmaster when
at sea is greater than that of any despot in
the world, from the czar down to the shirt-maker&#8217;s
sweater? I have always contended
that legally the master mariner is much too
much empowered. He can flog, he can starve,
he can iron the devils under him, and justify
any atrocity by an entry in the log-book and the
testimony of one or two witnesses who would
poison their mothers for a bottle of rum.
How, then, should this Mr. Samuel Rotch be
able to disturb the peace of your sweetheart?
Your anxiety puts the boot on the wrong leg,
my dear. It is for Mrs. Rotch to be uneasy.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>The next letter I received from Tom was
dated at sea a few leagues from the Scilly
Islands. He had brought his topsail to the
mast, he wrote, to send his letter by a little
coasting schooner that was inward bound.
He blessed me, and sent me many messages
of love, and wrote in high spirits of his ship
and crew. Rotch was very civil and alert, he
said, his crew as willing and active a body of
men as ever he had had charge of, and his
barque was a clipper, the swiftest fabric that
was ever bowed by a breeze of wind.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t mean to spare her,&#8217; he wrote,
&#8216;and she knows it. If there&#8217;s virtue in sail-cloth,
my beloved, she shall walk. She shall
whiten old ocean for your sake, my darling,
though it should come to my holding on with
my royals when we ought to be under double
reefs.&#8217;</p>

<p>I laughed when I read his sea-terms, for I
understood them; yet I pouted, too, for I was
fool enough to feel jealous of his admiration
for his barque. He ought to admire nothing
living or dead but me, I thought to myself.
He may go and fall in love with his ship, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
think her mistress enough for him, and then
I kissed his letter and read it again and yet
again, and counted how many days had gone
since he had left me, and how many weeks
must pass before he would return.</p>

<p>Much about this time aunt received a
letter from her son Will. This, too, was
addressed from sea. We had heard from
him from Plymouth&mdash;a few brief lines&mdash;and
not since. He wrote that they had met with
fearful weather in the Channel, and he believed
that he had mistaken his calling; he
would swap all his fine notions of starting on
a career and seeing the world for one hour of
the comfortable parlour near the Tower and a
good dinner of roast beef and cauliflower.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a dog&#8217;s life,&#8217; said he. &#8216;The captain
is stern and like a sentry. You mustn&#8217;t
speak to him. The second mate is a bit of a
bully, big, strong, and noisy. You never saw
such beef as they serve out in all your life!
The oldest sailor on board swears he never
recollects worse pork, and they say that before
we&#8217;re up with the Cape the bread for ship&#8217;s
use will be all alive&mdash;oh!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>&#8216;All first voyagers write like that,&#8217; said
my uncle, returning the letter to his wife;
&#8216;before Will is a fortnight at home he&#8217;ll be
making our lives a burden with his regrets
and lamentations that his ship doesn&#8217;t sail
sooner.&#8217;</p>

<small>SHE RECEIVES DREADFUL NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weeks went by. Day after day I eagerly
expected to receive a letter from Tom, making
sure that he would grasp every chance to
send me his love and blessing and all the
news about himself from those high seas on
which he was still afloat. But no letter
reached me, &#8216;simply because,&#8217; Mr. Johnstone
explained, &#8216;your Tom has not been fortunate
enough to fall in with a homeward-bound
ship. You may often sail for many days
upon the sea, so I&#8217;ve heard your father say,
without sighting a vessel. When you hear
from Tom it will be from Rio.&#8217;</p>

<p>But how I missed him! We had been
incessantly together for nearly four months.
The weeks might roll by, but there was no
magic in the time they contained to weaken
my sense of loss. I lived very quietly, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
much in my own home, where I sought to
pass the hours by reading and drawing. I
took a kind of dislike to company, and
refused a number of invitations to quadrille
and card parties and the like. It was my
delight to shape my conduct and habits by
the fancy of such wishes as I knew my sweetheart
would express were he with me. My
memory of him, my love for him, lay in a
spirit of control upon my heart. All impulse,
all desire was governed by the many gentle,
noble counsels he had wrapped up in our
long, sweet, quiet talks together, when we
rambled in the outskirts or took oars upon
the river. Never was man more truly loved
than was Tom. My aunt particularly noticed
the change in me, and said that Tom&#8217;s courtship
had done me a very great deal of good.</p>

<p>&#8216;You no longer roll your eyes,&#8217; said she,
&#8216;when you argue, and redden and strut and
heave up your breast when I venture to
object to your views. You have become
thoroughly genteel, my dear, in your tastes
and habits. Your captain will have a treasure
in you. And it is very well that you did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
marry him before he sailed, for I am certain
that his influence as a husband would not
have been so considerable as it has proved as
a lover. Both he and you are now having
plenty of leisure for thought, and when you
come together at the altar you will know
exactly what you are doing.&#8217;</p>

<p>In the month of November my little stepsister
died of peritonitis. I offered to nurse
her when it reached my ears that she was ill
in bed. Mr. Stanford thanked me; and
whilst I nursed her I learned to love the poor
little delicate creature, and my heart reproached
me for the unconquerable coldness
I had ever felt towards her when I stooped
and kissed her white face in death and beheld
a faint copy of my mother there. I cannot
tell to what degree Mr. Stanford was affected
by his loss; his colourless countenance betrayed
but little of what might pass in his
mind. Had I found his grief very great, then
the loneliness of his state would have pleaded,
and I might have forced myself into some
show of civility. But there was nothing in
his behaviour after his child&#8217;s death to appeal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and we speedily passed again into our old
cold relations of separate existence and fixed
dislike of him on my side as a fellow who had
impudently thrust himself into my father&#8217;s
place.</p>

<p>The nursing of the poor child, however,
together with my grief at her death and my
secret fretting over not hearing from Tom,
made me look ill if I did not feel so. My
aunt was concerned and insisted upon my
seeing her medical adviser, who recommended
her, spite of its being winter, to take me to
the seaside. It was the month of February&mdash;hard,
cold weather. My aunt knew and liked
Ramsgate, and proposed that town. Thither
we went and took lodgings in Wellington
Crescent, a pleasant row of buildings immediately
overlooking the English Channel.</p>

<p>After we had been in Ramsgate a few
days I felt so poorly that I was obliged to
keep my bed. My aunt called in a doctor,
who said that I was &#8216;out.&#8217; He sent me
physic, which I did not take, and told me to
keep my bed till I felt equal to rising. My
bed was so situated that, when my blind was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
up, I saw the ocean. If the day was clear,
I could faintly spy afar upon the horizon the
delicate golden thread of the Goodwin Sands.
I&#8217;d watch the ships slowly floating past this
side of the thin line like little clouds of
powder-smoke gliding ball-shaped from the
mouths of cannon, and listen to the faint
thunder of the surf combing the beach under
the chalk cliffs, and find a meaning for the
voice of the wind as it shrilled with a hissing
as of steam past the casement, or sang in
the interstices or muttered in the chimney.
The sight of the sea brought Tom very close
to me, closer than ever he could lie upon my
heart at home, amid streets and the rattle of
coaches and carts.</p>

<p>One morning, whilst I was confined to my
bed, my aunt did not come to my room as
was her custom after breakfast. I inquired
of the servant how she was, and was told that
she was pretty well, but that she had passed
an uneasy night. I asked if there were any
letters, for I was always expecting to hear
from Tom under cover from my maid, whom
I had left at home; the girl replied that Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Johnstone had received one letter, and that
there was none for me.</p>

<p>It was not until after twelve that my aunt
came to see me. She looked ill, and there was
a peculiar expression of distress in her face.
She came to the foot of my bed and gazed at
me earnestly, and asked me how I felt. I said
that I felt better, and hoped to find strength
to rise for a few hours towards evening.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are not looking well, aunt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am not feeling well, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope you have not received bad news
from home?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have had a broken night,&#8217; said she,
turning away and going to the window, and
speaking with her back upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you news of Will?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No! No!&#8217; she cried quickly, still with
her back turned. &#8216;There is no news of Will.
I believe you are better, my dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>And then she asked me what I could
fancy for dinner, and so changed the subject
with a readiness which quieted the misgiving
her looks had excited.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>She came and went during the day, as
she had heretofore done; but she was more
silent, more reserved than usual, and often
her eyes rested upon me, though she shifted
her gaze when I looked at her. I rose in
the afternoon, but in a few hours was glad
to get to bed again. Next day I felt decidedly
better and stronger. It was a bright, still
day, cloudless, and the sun lay warm upon
the land, and the sea stretched like a polished
plate of steel, full of gleams of different shades
of blue. I went down to the pier in an old-fashioned,
rickety chair, and my aunt walked
by my side. The harbour was gay with the
red canvas of smacks. A number of ships,
of many rigs, lay close in against the wall,
and their white canvas hung motionless in
festoons, drying after the rain or dew of the
night. The sweet, salt, still atmosphere was
refreshing to one&#8217;s innermost life. All sounds
came in a sort of music from the town, and I
heard a gay ringing of church bells as for a
marriage; the tones, silvered to the ear by
distance, mingled pleasantly with the noise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
of the foaming of the strong tide racing off
the rounded base of the pier.</p>

<p>I said to aunt: &#8216;When Tom and I are
married, we shall often come to Ramsgate,
and perhaps live here. I do not wonder that
you like the place.&#8217;</p>

<p>In silence she stepped to the side of the
pier, and seemed to look earnestly at the
figure of a smack that had dropped her
anchor about a mile off, her brown sails
hoisted, and the image under her as perfect
as a mirror could reflect it. When she returned
to my side, she spoke of the beauty of
the day and the difference between the air of
Stepney and that of Ramsgate, and we then
leisurely returned to our lodgings.</p>

<p>I was sure that some trouble weighed
upon her mind; but as my questions seemed
to make her peevish, as her worry might
relate to something which she would wish to
conceal from me, I forbore further inquiry.
That day passed, and next day I was well
enough to rise after breakfast and go into
the drawing-room, where I sat upon a sofa
wheeled close to the window. I was reading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
a novel, which my aunt had borrowed from
the Marine Library, and had wholly forgotten
myself in the interest of the story. My aunt
had been absent for at least an hour. I
believed she was out shopping. She entered
without her bonnet, and coming to the sofa,
sat down, took me by the hand and looked
me in the face. The tears gushed into her
eyes suddenly, and for a few moments she
moved her lips in a vain effort to speak. She
then said:</p>

<p>&#8216;I dare not conceal it longer from you,
Marian. But, oh, what news it is! How am
I to break it to you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I threw the book down. The neck of
my dress seemed to strangle me. Mechanically
I removed my brooch and eased the
tension of my neck with my finger whilst I
looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8216;It concerns Tom,&#8217; she said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he dead?&#8217; said I, speaking with a
heightened note in my voice that carried it
out of recognition of my own hearing.</p>

<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8216;Is it very bad news?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian,&#8217; she said, beginning to cry again,
&#8216;it is shocking bad news. It is incredible.
It may all come right, but it is not the less
terrible.&#8217;</p>

<p>I drew in several deep breaths, and said:
&#8216;Why will you not tell me this dreadful news
of Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is in London.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In London!&#8217; I shrieked, springing to
my feet.</p>

<p>She pulled me gently to the sofa, and
putting her hand in her pocket, drew forth a
letter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your health would not allow me to speak
to you before,&#8217; said she in a broken voice.
&#8216;Even now I fear that I am in too great a
hurry. But what am I to do? You would
not thank me for any longer concealing the
truth. Tom is in prison, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>I stared at her and shivered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your uncle&#8217;s letter,&#8217; she continued, opening
it with both hands which trembled excessively,
&#8216;will better explain what has happened
than I can. Will you read it?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>I took it. The handwriting reeled. I
returned the letter to her and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Read it to me, aunt.&#8217;</p>

<p>She did so. It was to this effect. After
all these years I am unable to give it you
word for word:</p>

<p>&#8216;I have a terrible piece of news to convey
to poor Marian through you. Captain Butler
is arrived in London, having been sent home
by the British Consul at Rio in H.M.S.
<i>Crusader</i>. He is charged by the mate and
carpenter of the <i>Arab Chief</i> with attempting
to scuttle her. These two men, together with
two sailors belonging to the crew of the <i>Arab
Chiefs</i> are landed with him from the <i>Crusader</i>.
He instantly sent for me, but I wish there
were not so many witnesses against him. That
he is absolutely innocent, and that he is the
victim of an atrocious conspiracy, I have not
the shadow of a doubt. He will be charged
at Bow Street on Monday, and will be advised
to reserve his defence. He will be committed,
of course, to take his trial at the Old Bailey,
and we must hope to come off with flying
colours. But I say again I could wish there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
were fewer witnesses. Four to one are fearful
odds.&#8217;</p>

<p>My aunt had read thus far when a flash of
lightning seemed to pass over my eyes, and I
remembered no more.</p>

<p>I recovered from a fit rather than a swoon.
I had been for above an hour unconscious,
and found myself on my bed, with the doctor
on one hand of me and my aunt on the other.
The doctor went away soon after I had
regained my mind. Memory was slow in
coming. It rushed in upon me on a sudden
with its burden of horror.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you going to do, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am going to London.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lie still, my dear child. You cannot go
to London to-day. I&#8217;ll book by the coach to-morrow
morning. I&#8217;ll write to your uncle
and send the letter to Canterbury to catch
the Dover mail-coach. He will be ready to
receive us and give us all the news.&#8217;</p>

<p>And, indeed, I should have found myself
too weak in body to carry out my resolution
to go at once to London. The railway to
Ramsgate was not then made. I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
that it was even in contemplation. A coach
left early for London from Ramsgate every
morning; it carried the mails, I think, and
travelled by way of Canterbury. When my
aunt found me somewhat composed, she went
to the office to secure places by the coach on
the morrow. She left me her husband&#8217;s
letter, and I read it again and again, and
every time I read it I rolled my eyes around
the room, seeking to realise that I was awake.</p>

<p>There was something shocking and frightful
to me in my uncle speaking of the Old
Bailey; I associated it with Newgate Prison.
Living in the City as I did, well did I know
the grim, dark, massive walls of that horrid
jail. Would Tom be locked up in that prison
which I could not think of without a sickening
fancy of the executions there&mdash;of the
remorseless human beasts, men and women
white with gin, gaping with the lust of blood,
gathered together to witness the sight&mdash;of the
filthy tenements round about, every window
pale with the eager faces of cowards and
devils, the grimy roofs littered with sightseers?
What was Tom charged with? What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
was the meaning of scuttling a ship? What
punishment was the act visited with? Was a
man hanged for scuttling?</p>

<p>I paced about the room in the agony of
my mind till I sank with exhaustion into a
chair. I dug the nails of my fingers into my
palms till the blood sprang. Tom in prison!
The gentlest, the tenderest, the truest, the
most honourable of men charged with a
dreadful crime, a hanging crime perhaps, and
locked up in jail!</p>

<small>SHE VISITS NEWGATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> blew almost a hurricane of wind that night.
It swept out of the east and stormed in
thunder against the house in which we lodged.
The rain burst in furious discharges upon the
window-panes, and the lightning was sun-bright
at times, and the noise of the rushing
sea was a continuous artillery which drowned
the loud peals from the clouds. All night
long I lay awake with wide-open eyes. Thrice
my aunt visited my bedside to see how I did
and every time I could give her no other
answer than that the thought of my sweetheart
lying in prison was driving me mad, was
killing me; so I would rave. I could think
of nothing but Tom. I had no sight for the
lightning, no ear for the thunder of the gale,
nor for the voice of the sea in its wrath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>It was clear weather next morning. We
breakfasted very early, walked to the coach,
and quitted Ramsgate at about eight o&#8217;clock.
It was a dreadful journey to me; endless as
the night to one who is shipwrecked and
watches for the dawn. The weather had
changed too; snow was falling at Canterbury
and it was bitterly cold all the way to London.
We reached my uncle&#8217;s house at ten o&#8217;clock
that night. My aunt&#8217;s letter had been received,
and a cheerful fire and a hot, comfortable
supper awaited us. My uncle came
downstairs to receive us and kissed us both
in silence, as though some one dear to us all
lay dead upstairs. Exhausted as I was by
the long journey, by the cold, by the dreadful
sufferings of my mind, I would still insist on
hearing of Tom, on learning how he was, how
he looked, the meaning of this dreadful thing
which had befallen him and me, before I
sat or took a bite or stirred a foot to the
bedroom to remove my travelling attire. But
my uncle was inflexible.</p>

<p>&#8216;Go with your aunt,&#8217; he exclaimed; &#8216;then
return with her here and warm and refresh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
yourself. I cannot talk rationally with one
who looks half dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>He forced me to obey, but I made haste
to rejoin him. He placed me close to the
fire and gave me some hot brandy and water
and a biscuit, which he said would act as a
stay till supper was served, and, my aunt
arriving, he began to talk about Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is charged&mdash;did I not write it?&mdash;with
attempting to scuttle his ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why should he do that?&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;To defraud the insurance offices. I told
him at the time that he erred by over-insuring,
but it seems that he went further
even than he admitted, for he put a venture
of cargo of his own into the vessel and insured
the goods and the freight in the Neptune.
Four offices!&#8217; he exclaimed, and he broke off,
looking down with a very grave face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where is he?&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;In Newgate,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t tell me that!&#8217; I shrieked, clasping
my hands and rocking myself.</p>

<p>My aunt stared with a white face at her
husband.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>&#8216;Now, Marian,&#8217; said my uncle, &#8216;if you
possess one particle of the spirit of your
father, let it animate and support you now&mdash;now,
and until this tragic affair is at an end.
Screams and lamentations are not going to
help Captain Butler. He says that he is the
victim of a diabolical conspiracy. I believe
it, and it will be our duty to prove it. What
is there about Newgate more than there is
about Millbank or the Hulks or Horsemonger
Lane to horrify you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why is he in Newgate?&#8217; asked my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;He was charged, yesterday, at Bow Street,
and committed to take his trial at the Central
Criminal Court. That&#8217;s why. There is nothing
in it. Many innocent men have been
locked up in Newgate.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who charges him with this crime?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;His mate, a man of the name of Rotch,
and a carpenter, a drunken rascal, of the
name of Nodder.&#8217;</p>

<p>And then he related the story of the accusation,
and described what had passed at
Bow Street on the preceding day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>Supper was served, and the presence of
the servant held us silent. I could not look
at the food I was helped to, and was passionately
craving for the servant to be gone that
I might question my uncle. Then, when the
opportunity came, I said to him:</p>

<p>&#8216;Is scuttling a ship a serious crime?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;One of the most serious.&#8217;</p>

<p>I trembled and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;What is the punishment for it?&#8217;</p>

<p>He was silent, as though he did not or
would not hear. I sprang up and shrieked
out:</p>

<p>&#8216;Uncle, is it hanging?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It would have been hanging two or three
years ago,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Thank God, it is no
longer a capital crime.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What can they do to Tom?&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Control yourself, my dear child,&#8217; said my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, uncle, what can they do to him?&#8217; I
cried again.</p>

<p>&#8216;They must first prove him guilty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And then&mdash;and then?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The penalty is transportation.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>&#8216;He may be sent out of the country?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, to Norfolk Island or Tasmania or
Botany Bay,&#8217; answered my uncle, in a voice
sullen with his sympathy with my misery.</p>

<p>&#8216;For how long?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll drive yourself mad with these
questions,&#8217; said my aunt. &#8216;He is not yet
convicted.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;For how long, uncle?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;For a term&mdash;perhaps for life. But he is
innocent, and we must prove him so.&#8217;</p>

<p>I flung myself into an arm-chair and
buried my face. Yet I could not weep; I
had cried away all my tears. But, oh, the
torment in my half-strangled throat, and the
anguish of my dry, heart-breaking sobs!</p>

<p>After a while, I succeeded in forcing a
sort of composure upon myself. We sat
talking until long past midnight. I asked
many questions as rationally and as collectedly
as I could; but I remarked, with
secret horror, in my uncle&#8217;s speech a note of
misgiving that sank into my spirits like a
knife into the heart. Indeed, it seemed more
than misgiving, even dark suspicion in him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
He said not a word to justify what I felt;
but he talked of four to one, and again he
talked of Tom&#8217;s exaggerated precaution in
excessively insuring his venture, and I guessed
what was in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall be able to score one good
point,&#8217; said he. &#8216;The mate Rotch, some five
or six years ago, quarrelled with your sweetheart
Tom, at Valparaiso. Butler was then
mate of a ship. They met at a fandango.
Rotch insulted a young lady Butler had been
dancing with and had previously known.
Your sweetheart took him by the throat and
backed him out of the room, half suffocated
and black in the face. Strangely enough,
two years later, Butler found himself master
of a small Indiaman, called the <i>Chanticleer</i>,
with this same man Rotch as second mate
under him. The mate of the <i>Chanticleer</i> complained
much of Rotch&#8217;s insolence. One night,
when in Soundings, homeward bound, Butler
found Rotch sleeping in his watch, with a
dozen ships looming dark all round. This was
extraordinary. Butler reported his conduct
to the owners of the <i>Chanticleer</i>, and the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
lost his berth. But on your sweetheart learning
that Rotch had been married shortly
before sailing, and that a child had been born
to him during his absence at sea, he went
to work to procure his reinstatement or to
obtain another situation for him, and was
successful. There may be other motives;
but here is a point that must go far to confirm
Butler&#8217;s declaration that he is the victim
of a conspiracy.&#8217;</p>

<p>I listened greedily. I kept my eyes,
smarting and burning, fastened upon my
uncle&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is scuttling a ship?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did I not explain? It is boring a hole
in her so that she may sink.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who says that Tom bored a hole in his
ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotch and Nodder and two seamen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Did they see him bore the hole?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They affirm that they saw the holes
which he had bored, and discovered a tree-nail
auger in his cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, he would not do it!&#8217; I cried. &#8216;It is
a lie! He is innocent!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>Here my aunt advised me to go to bed,
and said that she herself could sit up no
longer. But I detained my uncle for another
half hour with many feverish, impassioned
questions, before I could force myself from
the room, and a church bell struck one
through the stillness of the snowing night as
I went to the bedroom that had been prepared
for me.</p>

<p>My uncle was to see Tom next morning
at Newgate, and told me he would inquire
the rules and bring about a meeting between
my sweetheart and me as speedily as possible.
After breakfast, my box was put into a coach,
and I drove to my house in Stepney. Mr.
Stanford came into the hall to speak to me.
I forced a wild smile and a hurried bow and
pushed past. I could not address him nor
listen to what he had to say. When I went
upstairs and sat down in my own room, the
room in which Tom and Will had dined with
me, where I had passed hours in sweet musings
upon my lover, where there were many
little things he had given me&mdash;a picture I
had admired, a screen, a little French chimney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
clock, above all, his miniature&mdash;I believed my
heart was breaking. I wept and wept; I
could not stay my tears. My maid stood
beside me, caressed and tried to control me,
then drew off and stood looking at me, afraid.</p>

<p>By-and-by I rallied, and since activity was
life to me&mdash;for sitting still and thinking were
heart-breaking and soul-withering to one situated
as I was, without a father or a mother
to carry her grief to, without an intimate
friend to open herself to&mdash;I considered what
I should do; and then I reflected that all the
money which I could scrape together might
be needful for Tom&#8217;s defence. Thereupon I
went straight to the bank into which my
trustees paid my money, and ascertained how
my account stood. I saw the manager of the
bank and asked him to what amount he would
allow me to overdraw, should the need arise,
and he told me that I was at liberty to overdraw
to a considerable sum against the security
of the title-deeds of my house, which were in
his possession, and which had been originally
lodged at the bank by my father.</p>

<p>This and other errands I went upon helped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
to kill the day, and the distraction did me a
little good. In the afternoon, before it was
dusk, I walked as far as Ludgate Hill, and
turned into the Old Bailey, and went a little
distance up Newgate Street, and continued
walking there that I might be near Tom. I
crossed the street and looked at the horrible
walls, dark with the grime of London, and at
the spiked gates, and at a huddle of miserable,
tattered wretches at one of those gates, as
though they yearned in their starvation and
misery for the prison food and the shelter of
the cells within; and I wondered in what
part behind those fortress-like walls my sweetheart
was, what his thoughts were, what he
was doing, if he was thinking of me as I was
of him, until I stamped the pavement in a
sudden agony of mind, and crossed the street
to the walls, and went along the pavement
close beside them, to and fro, to and fro.</p>

<p>The dusk drove me away at last, and
being very weary, I called a coach and went
to my aunt&#8217;s, that I might get the latest news
of Tom. My uncle had had a long interview
with my sweetheart in the morning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>&#8216;He is fairly cheerful and hopeful,&#8217; said
he. &#8216;You will scarcely know him, though.
His anxiety during the long voyage home in
the man-of-war has pinched and wrinkled
and shrunk him. You&#8217;ll see him to-morrow.
We will go together.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Uncle, you will employ the very best
people on his side.&#8217; He named a well-known
Old Bailey pleader of those days. &#8216;Do not
stint in money, uncle. All that I have in the
world is Tom&#8217;s,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8216;The deuce of it is,&#8217; exclaimed my uncle,
thumping his knee, &#8216;we have no witnesses to
call except as to character. It&#8217;s four-tongued
positive swearing on one side, and single-tongued
negative swearing on the other.&#8217;</p>

<p>So ran our talk. It was all about Tom.
As on the previous evening so now again I
kept my kind-hearted uncle up till past midnight
with my feverish questions. My aunt
had asked me to sleep in their house, and I
gladly consented, partly that I might be instantly
ready to accompany my uncle to
Newgate at the appointed time, and partly
because I dreaded the loneliness of my home,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the long and dismal solitude of the evening
and the night in a scene crowded with
memories of my father and my mother and
my sweetheart, of my childhood, of the sunny
hours of my holiday rambling and of careless
merry days of independence. I could not
sleep, through thinking of the morrow&#8217;s meeting.
It was seven months since Tom and I
had kissed and parted. He had sailed away
full of hope. He had written in high spirits.
And now he was a prisoner in Newgate; his
ship taken from him; the prospects of the
voyage ruined; his innocent, manly heart
infamously shamed and degraded, charged
with a crime which might banish him for
ever from England!</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not be shocked,&#8217; said my uncle, in
the morning, &#8216;because you will not be suffered
to speak to him face to face. You will presently
see what I mean. It is mere prison
routine&mdash;a quite necessary discipline. There&#8217;s
nothing in it.&#8217;</p>

<p>After all these years I but vaguely remember
as much of this horrible jail as we
traversed. My heart beat with a pulse of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
fever; my sight fell dim in the gloom after
the whiteness of the day outside. I seemed
to see nothing, but I looked always for my
sweetheart as we advanced. I recollect little
more than the door of Newgate jail, with its
flanking of huge, black, fortress-like wall, the
iron-grated windows, the heavy, open doors
faced with iron, the dark passages, in one of
which hung an oil lamp, and the strange sight
beyond this gloomy passage of stone floor
touched with barred sunlight flowing through
an iron grating. Many structural changes have
been made in the interior of Newgate since
those days. We entered a passage walled on
either hand by gratings and wirework. Some
warders in high hats and blue coats&mdash;warders
or constables, I know not which&mdash;stood outside
this passage. My uncle was at my side,
and we waited for my sweetheart to appear.
There was but one prisoner then present. He
was conversing through the grating with a
dark-skinned, black-eyed woman of about
forty, immensely stout and dressed in many
bright colours. He was clothed in the garb
of the felon, and was enormously thick-set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
and powerfully built; you saw the muscles of
his arms tighten the sleeves of his jacket as
he gesticulated with Hebraic demonstrativeness
to the woman whose voice was as harsh
as a parrot&#8217;s. His hair was cropped close;
where his whiskers and beard were shaved
his skin was a dark coarse blue; he was
deeply pitted with small-pox; his nose lay
somewhat flat upon his face with very thick
nostrils; his brows were black and heavily
thatched, and the eyes they protected were
coal black as the Indian&#8217;s, but amazingly darting.
My uncle looked at him with interest,
and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8216;I was at that man&#8217;s trial. He was sentenced
to the hulks and to transportation for
life for receiving stolen goods and keeping a
notorious house. He is a Jew prize-fighter,
and one of the very best that ever stood up in
a ring. Three years ago he beat the Scotch
champion Sandy Toomer into pulp. He&#8217;s a
terrible ruffian, and a villain of the deepest
dye, but a noble prize-fighter, and I am sorry
for Barney Abram.&#8217;</p>

<p>The felon took no notice of us spite of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
uncle staring at him, as though he had been
one of the greatest of living men. I glanced
at the horrid creature, but thought only of
Tom.</p>

<p>I was glad of the delay in his coming. I
had time to collect myself and to force an
expression of calmness into my face. On a
sudden he appeared! He came in by the
side of a warder from the direction of a
yard, in which my uncle afterwards told me
prisoners who had not yet had their trials
took the air. He was dressed in his own
clothes, in seafaring apparel somewhat soiled
by wear. I had feared to see him in the
vile attire of a convict, and was spared a
dreadful shock, when I looked and beheld
my dear one as I remembered him! But oh!
not as I remembered him! He had let his
beard grow; he was shaggy and scarce recognisable
with it, and his hair was longer
than formerly. His cheeks were sunk, his
eyes dull, like the eyes of one who has not
slept for weeks, his lips pale, his complexion
strange and hardly describable, owing to the
pallor that had sifted through, so to speak,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
and mottled the sun-brown of his skin. But
his old beauty was there to my love; my
heart gave a great leap when I saw him; and
I cried his name and extended my arms against
the wire of the grating.</p>

<p>He looked at me steadfastly for some
moments with his teeth hard set upon his
under lip, as though he dared not attempt to
speak until he had conquered his emotion
and mastered such tears as burn like fire in
the brain of a man. My uncle gently saluted
him through the bars, and then motioned
with his hand, and, taking me by the arm, led
me down to the extremity of this jail meeting-place,
and Tom walked on the opposite side
until he was abreast. My uncle then moved
some distance away and stood watching the
Jew prize-fighter. A warder walked leisurely
to and fro; and others at a little distance
stood like sentinels.</p>

<p>My sweetheart&#8217;s first words were:</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, before God I am innocent.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, I know it&mdash;I know it, dearest, and
your innocence shall be proved.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Before God I am innocent,&#8217; he repeated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
softly and without passion in his tones or posture.
&#8216;It is a devilish plot of Rotch to ruin
me. I don&#8217;t know why the carpenter Nodder
should swear against me. I had no quarrel
with the man. But he&#8217;d go to the gallows for
drink, and in that Rotch found his opportunity
since he needed a witness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You will be able to prove your innocence.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotch,&#8217; he continued, still speaking softly
and without temper, &#8216;bored holes in the lazarette;
then plugged the lining and hid the
auger in my cabin. Nodder swears that I
borrowed the auger from him. A lie, Marian&mdash;a
wicked, horrible lie. Why should I
borrow an auger? Why should I, as captain,
handle such a tool as that when there is a
carpenter in the ship? Rotch brought some
of the men aft to listen to the water running
into the lazarette. He says that he went
below to break out stores and heard it. A
hellish lie, Marian. He swears that he plugged
the holes to stop the leaks and came up with
the men to search my cabin. I was in my
cabin when they entered, and on the scoundrel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Rotch charging me with attempting to
scuttle the barque and imperilling the lives of
the crew, I pulled a pistol out of my drawer
and would have shot him. They threw themselves
upon me, and Rotch called to them to
search the cabin, and they found the auger in
the place where the villain had hidden it.
But this was not all. Rotch swore before the
Consul at Rio that he had seen me go into
the lazarette, and that he had mentioned the
circumstance to Nodder, but that neither
suspected what I was doing until Rotch himself
went below for some boatswain&#8217;s stores,
and then he heard the water running in.
Marian,&#8217; and here he slightly raised his voice,
&#8216;it is a conspiracy, artfully planned, artfully
executed, artfully related, with the accursed
accident of the over-insured venture to make
it significant as death, and God alone knows
how it may go with me.&#8217;</p>

<p>A warder paused and looked at us, then
passed on.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t say that,&#8217; I cried; &#8216;it breaks my
heart to hear you say that. You are innocent.
My uncle will employ clever men. They will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
question and question and prove the wretches
liars, and our turn will come.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I blundered by over-insuring, but I
blundered more fearfully still when in a
moment of confidence I told the villain Rotch
what money I had embarked in this voyage,
and to what extent I had protected myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, whatever happens I am with you.
Oh, if it should come to their killing you they
shall kill me too, Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>He pressed his hands to his heart and
then sobbed twice or thrice. My love, my
grief, my misery raged in me; I felt that I had
strength to tear down the strong iron grating
which separated us, that I might get to him,
clasp him to me, give him the comfort of my
bosom, the tenderness of my caressing cheek.
It worked like madness in my soul to be held
apart from him, to see him and not be able to
fling my arms around him.</p>

<p>We looked at each other in silence. I
was about to speak when a bell rang, and a
strong voice called out: &#8216;Time&#8217;s up!&#8217; The
prize-fighter was gone. A warder marched
quickly along to Tom and touched him on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
shoulder, and my uncle called to me: &#8216;Come,
Marian.&#8217; Tom cried: &#8216;God bless you, dear,&#8217;
but my vision was blind with tears, a sudden
swooning headache made me stagger, and
until I was in the street I was scarcely sensible
of more than of being led through the
passages and out through the gate by my
uncle.</p>

<small>SHE ATTENDS HER SWEETHEART&#8217;S TRIAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> to the date of the trial, suspense and
expectation lay in so crushing a burden upon
me that life was hardly supportable. In this
time I ceased to wonder that people had the
courage to perish by their own hands. Twice
after that first visit I saw Tom in Newgate,
but those interviews were restricted by the
rules of the place to a quarter of an hour,
and always the bell sounded and the rude
voice of the warder broke in at the moment
when I had most to say and most to hearken
to.</p>

<p>The trial of my sweetheart took place at
the Central Criminal Court on April 17th.
The judge was the stony-hearted Maule&mdash;memory
may deceive me, but I am almost
sure it was Mr. Justice Maule. For Tom&#8217;s
defence my uncle had secured the services of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the celebrated Mr. Sergeant Shee, with whom
were Mr. Doane and Mr. C. Jones. I drove
down to the Old Bailey with my aunt early in
the morning. The court was not inconveniently
crowded. It was one of those cases
which do not excite much attention. A Cash-man
or a Bishop would have blocked the
court with eager spectators of both sexes, but
the perils and crimes of the ocean do not
appeal to the land-going public.</p>

<p>The judge took his seat at ten o&#8217;clock,
and Tom was brought in and placed at the
bar, charged by indictment that &#8216;he endeavoured,
feloniously and maliciously, to
cast away and destroy a certain vessel called
the <i>Arab Chief</i> on the high sea, within the
jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England, and
also of the Central Criminal Court, with intent
to prejudice divers persons as part owners of
or underwriters to the same vessel.&#8217; He
pleaded &#8216;Not guilty.&#8217; He spoke very low,
but his tones were steady. He looked ill,
haggard, and wasted. A great number of
persons who were to appear as witnesses
were in court, and I searched the many faces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
with burning eyes for the two wretches who
had brought my sweetheart and me to this
horrible pass. But my aunt did not know
them, and there was no one at hand to tell
me which among those men were Rotch and
Nodder.</p>

<p>The case against Tom, as stated at the
opening of the prosecution, was merely an
elaborate version of the narrative of the facts
which he had himself briefly related to me in
Newgate. Though nobody had been defrauded,
since the ship had not been sunk and
no money claimed or paid, yet as much
emphasis was laid by the prosecution upon
the number of offices in which Tom had
insured as though my sweetheart&#8217;s guilt were
beyond question, as though the prosecution
indeed had seen him make holes in the ship
and sink her, as though he had then arrived
in England and received three or four thousand
pounds in excess of the worth of the property.</p>

<p>The person who addressed the Court for
the prosecution had a very clear, musical
voice; he had handsome eyes, and would
pause at every pointed passage of his opening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
with an eloquent, appealing, concerned look
at the jury. His sweet, persuasive tones
and looks doubled to my fear the horrible
significance of his statements, and I abhorred
him whilst I watched him and listened, and
could have killed him in my concealed fright
and rage for his cool and coaxing and polished
utterance of what I knew to be hellish lies.
Often would I watch the jury with a devouring
gaze. They were in two rows, six in a
row, in a box, and one or another who was
above would sometimes lean over and whisper,
and one would take a note, and one would sit
for ten minutes at a time motionless, with his
eyes upon the person speaking. The counsel
and gentlemen in wigs and gowns sat around
a big table loaded with books and papers.
A crowd of people hung about outside this
sort of well, formed by the table and its
circular benches and backs, and whispered
and stared and grinned and took snuff. The
judge sat, stern and heavily wigged, not far
from the jury. Sometimes he took notes;
sometimes his chin sank upon his breast.
He seemed to see nothing, and if ever he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
spoke he appeared to address a vision in midair.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll not trouble you with the particulars of
this trial. I am passing rapidly now into
another scene of life. One witness after
another stepped into the box to prove the
several insurances which had been effected
by Tom; others to testify to the value of the
<i>Arab Chief</i> and her lading. The name of
Samuel Rotch was then pronounced, and the
man came out of a group of people and
briskly ascended to give evidence. The hot
blood stung in my cheeks when I saw him.
My heart beat as though I was stricken with
fever. Tom looked at him and kept his eyes
upon him all the while that the wretch was
answering questions and giving his evidence,
but I never once observed that he even so
much as glanced at my sweetheart.</p>

<p>I had expected&mdash;nay, indeed, I had prayed&mdash;to
behold an ill-looking villain, and I believe
it told heavily against us that he was an
exceedingly good-looking man. His features
were regular; his eyes of dark blue, bright
and steadfast in their gaze. His white and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
regular teeth shone like light when he parted
his lips. He was coloured by the sun to the
manly complexion of the seaman, and he was
about Tom&#8217;s height, well built, but without
my sweetheart&#8217;s fine, upright, commanding
carriage. His voice had a frank note. His
replies were quickly delivered, and there was
not the least stammer or hesitation in his
statements. Added to all this, he spoke with
an educated accent.</p>

<p>He told his story plainly, and was not to
be shaken. He gave a reason for going into
the lazarette which my sweetheart&#8217;s counsel
seemed unable to challenge. It was shown
through his evidence that the size of the
holes (an inch and a quarter) which were
found plugged in the inner skin exactly corresponded
with the diameter of the tree-nail
auger which had been discovered in Tom&#8217;s
cabin. His evidence was that whilst in the
lazarette he had heard the sound of water
running into the ship betwixt the lining and
the side; he took his lantern to the place of
the noise and saw the plugged holes. He
went on deck and called to Benjamin Nodder,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
who acted as second mate and carpenter; he
likewise summoned others of the crew and
they all went into the lazarette and saw the
plugged holes and heard the water coming in.
Then to preserve their lives and save the ship
from sinking they ripped up the plank and
plugged the outer holes, thus stopping the
leaks, and afterwards repaired in a body to
the captain&#8217;s cabin. Captain Butler threatened
to shoot the witness. He was secured, and
the cabin searched and the auger found.
They proceeded to Rio, and on their arrival
Rotch called upon the British Consul, who
on the evidence sworn before him thought
proper to give the charge of the ship to
a new captain and send home the prisoner,
together with Rotch, Nodder, and two of
the seamen who had descended into the lazarette.</p>

<p>The witness was asked why he suspected
the captain of attempting to scuttle the ship
instead of any other of the crew.</p>

<p>He answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;Because I had seen the captain go into
the lazarette.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>&#8216;Was it unusual for a captain to enter the
lazarette of his own vessel?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No captain,&#8217; the fellow answered, &#8216;would
think of entering a lazarette.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What other grounds for suspicion had
he?&#8217;</p>

<p>The man replied, the captain had told
him that his share in the ship, together with
his venture in the cargo and freight, were
heavily insured; also, on one occasion, the
captain had talked to him about a ship
whose master had been sentenced and executed
for casting her away; and he had
added significantly that it was a good job the
law had been changed, and that a man might
now venture for a fortune without jeopardising
his life.</p>

<p>Tom steadfastly regarded Rotch whilst he
gave his evidence; and I knew by the look
in my sweetheart&#8217;s face that the villain in the
witness-box fiendishly lied in every syllable
he uttered.</p>

<p>Many questions in cross-examination were
asked, and all of them Rotch answered steadily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
bowing respectfully whenever the judge put a
question; and he always looked very straight,
with a fine air of candour and honesty, at the
person who interrogated him. He was asked
if he had not quarrelled with Captain Butler
at Valparaiso. He answered yes. The particulars
of that quarrel were dramatically related
by Sergeant Shee. Rotch said that every
word was true, but that he and Captain Butler
had long ago shaken hands over that affair
and dismissed it from their memory. He
was asked if the prisoner had not reported
him on one occasion for insubordination and
neglect of duty, and if he had not been dismissed
in consequence, though subsequently
another berth had been procured for him by
the prisoner? He answered yes, it was quite
true. He was asked if it was the fact that
one of the owners of the <i>Arab Chief</i> had
promised him the berth of captain of that
ship in any case, since, whether guilty or
innocent, Captain Butler would not, after this
accusation, be again employed? He replied it
was true; but then the other side qualified
what was to me a damning admission by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
saying that the fellow was distantly connected
with the owner aforesaid.</p>

<p>The next witness was Benjamin Nodder.
This fellow was a rough seaman of a commonplace
type, hunched about the shoulders and
bandy-legged, with red hair falling about his
ears in coarse raw streaks, like slices of
carrot; he was wall-eyed, that is, one eye
looked away when the other gazed straight.
His voice was harsh as the noise of an axe
sharpened on a grindstone, and when he
stood up in the box he leered unsteadily
around him with an effort to stand with
dignity, as though he was tipsy. His examination
was little more than a repetition
of what had been gone through with Rotch.</p>

<p>He was followed by two seamen who had
no further evidence to give than that they
had helped to stop the leaks and had seen
the captain draw a pistol upon Rotch in his
cabin; they also testified to the discovery
of the auger, one of them saving that he
recollected Mr. Nodder telling the men that
Captain Butler had come forward and borrowed
an auger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>&#8216;Mr. Nodder,&#8217; said this witness, &#8216;told us
men that he couldn&#8217;t imagine what the capt&#8217;n
wanted an auger for; two days after the hole
was found bored in the lazarette.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thus ran the questions and the answers.
Tom looked steadily at the witnesses as they
spoke; but he made no sign; his arms lay
motionless, folded upon his breast. Twice
or thrice I saw his eyebrows faintly lift, and
his lips part as though to a deep breath of
irrepressible horror and amazement.</p>

<p>The Court adjourned for lunch after the
two seamen had given their evidence; I
remained in the court with my aunt. Mr.
Johnstone came to us, and I asked him what
he thought the verdict would be.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wait for it! Wait for it!&#8217; he exclaimed,
petulant with worry and doubts. &#8216;Did not I
tell Butler that he had heavily blundered in
over-insuring? And how well Rotch gave
his evidence! How frank were the devil&#8217;s
admissions! Never a wink or a stutter with
him from beginning to end! But the twelve
have yet to hear the sergeant. Keep up
your spirits, Marian!&#8217; And he abruptly left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
us, but not without exchanging a look with
his wife. I caught that look, and my heart
sank and turned cold, as though the hand of
death had grasped it.</p>

<p>When the Court reassembled, five witnesses
were called to speak to Tom&#8217;s character.
It was shortly before four when the
judge had finished summing up. I had followed
Sergeant Shee&#8217;s address with impassioned
attention, eagerly watching the faces
of the jurymen as he spoke, and detesting
the judge for the sleepy air with which he
listened and the barristers at the table and
the people round about for their inattention
and frequent whispers and passing of papers
one to another on business of their own, as
though the drama of life or death to me
which had nearly filled the day had grown
tiresome, and they were waiting for the
curtain. Then I had followed with a maddening
conflict of emotion, but with an ever-gaining
feeling of sickness and faintness, like
to the sense of a poisoned and killing conviction
slowly creeping to the heart against
its maddest current of hopes and protests&mdash;thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
had I listened to the address of the
counsel for the prosecution who replied upon
the whole case; and now I listened to Mr.
Justice Maule&#8217;s summing-up, a tedious and
inconclusive address. He made little of the
points which I believed he would have
insisted upon. He talked like a tired man,
he retold the testimony, and I seemed to
find a prejudice against Tom throughout his
delivery.</p>

<p>Then it was left to the jury, and the jury,
after an absence of twenty minutes, returned
with the verdict of &#8216;Guilty&#8217; against the
prisoner.</p>

<p>My aunt clutched my hand. I felt a
shock as though the blood in my veins had
been arrested in ice in its course. Mr. Justice
Maule proceeded to pass sentence. He spoke
in a sing-song voice, as though at every
instant he must interrupt himself with a
yawn. He said that the prisoner had been
found guilty, after a fair and impartial trial,
of the offence of having feloniously and wilfully
attempted to destroy the ship <i>Arab
Chief</i> for the purpose of defrauding the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
underwriters. That was the conclusion the
jury had arrived at, and he was perfectly
satisfied with this verdict. And then he
pointed out the gravity of the offence, and
how such acts tended to check the spirit of
mercantile adventure, and how impossible it
would be for insurance companies to exist if
they were not protected by the law. He
rejoiced that the penalty applied to this crime
was no longer capital. At the same time it
was his duty to inflict a severe punishment.
The sentence of the Court was that the prisoner
should be transported beyond the seas for the
term of fourteen years.</p>

<p>My aunt sprang to her feet and shrieked
aloud when this awful sentence was delivered.
I sat dumb and motionless. Never once
throughout the day had Tom looked in our
direction. Now, on my aunt shrieking, he
turned his head, saw me, and pointed upward,
as though surrendering our love to God. The
next moment he had stepped out of sight.</p>

<p>My uncle came to us. He was white
and terribly agitated and shocked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>&#8216;Come!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;Come along
out of this now. We have had enough of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took me by the hand, and I arose, but
I could not speak; I seemed to have been
deprived of sensation in the limbs; indeed, I
do not know what had come to me. I looked
towards the bar where Tom had been standing
and sighed, and then walked with my uncle,
my aunt following. We passed out of the
court and got into the Old Bailey; and when
in Ludgate Hill, my uncle called a coach, and
we were driven to his home. Nothing was
said saving that my uncle once asked, &#8216;Who
cried out?&#8217; My aunt answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;I did.&#8217;</p>

<p>I sat rigid, looking with blind eyes at the
passing show of the streets. But how am I
to describe my feelings! Ask a mother whose
child has suddenly died upon her lap; ask a
wife whose husband has fallen dead at her
feet; ask an adoring lover whose sweetheart,
taking refuge with him from a summer
thunder-cloud, is slain by a bolt; ask such
people so smitten to tell you what they feel!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Nor can my tongue utter what was in me as
we drove to my uncle&#8217;s home after the trial.</p>

<p>When we were arrived my manner frightened
my aunt; she feared I&#8217;d do myself a
mischief and would not lose sight of me. I
sat in a chair and never spoke, though I
answered when I was addressed, and obeyed
mechanically; as, for example, if my aunt
entreated me to come to the table and eat I
quitted my chair and took up the knife and
fork, but without eating. My gaze was fixed!
I saw nothing but Tom standing at the bar of
the Old Bailey, hearkening to his sentence,
lifting up his hand to me and looking upward.
If I turned my eyes toward my aunt, Tom
was behind her. If my uncle sat before me
and addressed me, the vision of Tom painted
in bright colours receiving sentence and lifting
his hand was behind him.</p>

<p>Once during the evening of the day of
the trial, when my uncle came into the parlour,
my aunt turned to him and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;If she would only cry!&#8217;</p>

<p>She took me to her bed that night, and I
lay without speech, seeing Tom as in a vision,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
and hearing the sentence over and over again
repeated. I may have slept; I cannot tell.
My aunt wished me to remain in bed next
morning, but when she was dressed I got up
and followed her to the parlour.</p>

<p>My uncle sat by a glowing fire; he was
deeply interested in a newspaper and was probably
reading a report of the trial.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aunt,&#8217; I said, speaking for the first time,
and in a voice so harsh and unmusical that
my uncle, not knowing that I had entered,
looked up with gesture of surprise and
dropped the newspaper, &#8216;I wish to go home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, dear, not yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was about to speak, to say that I believed
my going to the house where my father
and mother had lived&mdash;to the house that was
full of old associations, where I had thought
to dwell with Tom when we were married&mdash;would
soothe and do me good. I was about
to tell her this, but could not for giving way;
and, hiding my face in my hands, I bowed
my head upon the table, neither of them
speaking nor attempting in any way to arrest
the passion of tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>I felt better after this dreadful outbreak;
it seemed to have cleansed my brain and to
give room for my heart to beat and for my
spirits to stir in. I looked at the good things
upon the table, the eggs and bacon, the ham
and the rest, and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;How do they feed prisoners in jail?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, don&#8217;t trouble about that, Marian,&#8217;
said my uncle. &#8216;Captain Butler has been a
sailor, and he has been bred up on food compared
to which the worst fare in the worst jail
in England is delicious.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What will they do with him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Until they despatch him across the seas
they&#8217;ll keep him in prison at Newgate, perhaps,
or they&#8217;ll send him to Millbank or to the
Hulks. No man can tell.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t fret yourself now with these inquiries,
Marian,&#8217; said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;How do they treat convicts in jail,
uncle?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well, indeed. Better than the
majority of them deserve. They feed them,
clothe them, and teach them trades to enable
them to live honestly by-and-by.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>&#8216;In what sort of ships do the convicts
sail?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, in average merchantmen. Owners
tender, and a ship is hired. There were
twenty-one of them chartered last year at
about four p&#8217;un&#8217; ten a ton.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Twenty-one!&#8217; cried my aunt. &#8216;I wonder
there are any rascals left in England. Twenty-one!
Only think! And perhaps two hundred
rogues in each ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;At least,&#8217; exclaimed my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are they passenger ships?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Many of them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Could one take one&#8217;s passage in a convict
ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Love you, no! No more than one could
take one&#8217;s passage in a man-of-war.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, you are making no breakfast,&#8217;
said my aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do they do with the convicts when
they arrive at their destination?&#8217; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said my uncle, passing his cup for
more tea, &#8216;I can only tell you what I have
read. The convicts are lent out as servants
to persons in want of labour on their farms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
houses, shops, and so on; some of them are
sent up country to make roads. I don&#8217;t know
whether they are paid for their work. They
are well fed. It commonly ends in their
setting up in business for themselves; and
ninety-nine out of every hundred felons, after
they have been out in the colonies for a few
years, wouldn&#8217;t come home&mdash;to stay at home,
I mean&mdash;on any account whatever. If I were
a poor man, I should not at all object to
being transported.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t say such things!&#8217; exclaimed my
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall follow Tom wherever he is sent,&#8217;
said I, pushing my chair from the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;What! To Norfolk Island, for instance?
What would you do there?&#8217; said my uncle.
&#8216;Far better wait in this country, my dear,
until Captain Butler returns. They&#8217;ll be
giving him a ticket-of-leave before long. He&#8217;s
bound to behave himself well.&#8217;</p>

<p>I stepped to the window and looked out.
There had been a note of coldness in my
uncle&#8217;s pronunciation of the words, &#8216;Captain
Butler.&#8217; I had also caught a startled look,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
which was nearly horror, in my aunt when I
said that I would follow my sweetheart wherever
he was sent. I turned presently and
said:</p>

<p>&#8216;When shall I be able to see Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Once only every three months, I am
afraid,&#8217; answered my uncle. &#8216;The rules vary
with the prisons, but I think you will find that
letters and visits are allowed once every three
months only. I&#8217;ll inquire.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall we hear if he is sent to another
place?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall always be able to learn where
he is.&#8217;</p>

<p>He was growing tired of my questions and
left the table, having finished his breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall want to know what his defence
has cost,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I wish to pay.&#8217;</p>

<p>He nodded, and, pulling out his watch,
said that he must go to business downstairs.
I ran after him as he was leaving the room,
and, grasping him by the arm, cried impetuously:
&#8216;Uncle, do you believe Tom guilty?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d not say so if I thought so,&#8217; he
answered looking at me, and I guessed by my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
feelings that my eyes sparkled and my cheeks
were red. &#8216;Let me go, my girl. Everything
passes, and to all of us comes a day when we
discover that there is nothing under the sun
which is worth a tear.&#8217;</p>

<p>I dropped my hand, and we walked out of
the room. My aunt eyed me strenuously as I
paced the floor. I could not sit, my heart
was full of rage, and all the while a resolution
was forming and hardening in me; indeed
I caught myself thinking aloud, and often
I&#8217;d halt with my hand clenched like one
distraught. My aunt presently said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Why not sit down, dear, and nurse your
strength a little? You have been sorely
tried. Cannot we arrange for another trip to
the seaside?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And leave&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; I cried, and broke short
off and forced myself to say softly: &#8216;No,
aunt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But what do you mean to do? I wish to
act as a mother to you, Marian. I thank God
you are not his wife.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t say that!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I must say it!&#8217; she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
bridling. &#8216;It&#8217;s through me that you are
not his wife, and I rejoice heartily that I
advised you as I did. What! Would you,
with your means and your beauty and your
opportunities, be the wife of a convict?&#8217;</p>

<p>I felt the temper in me swelling into madness.
I durst not stay, for I dreaded myself
then, and flung out of the room, leaving her
talking. I ran upstairs to put on my outdoor
clothes, and when I returned my aunt
was on the landing. She exclaimed that she
had not meant what she said. I looked her
earnestly in the face, for I did not believe
her; but already my temper was gone. Ill-temper
lives but a short time when there is
great misery. I kissed her and thanked her
for her kindness and love, and, telling her I
must go home to look after things, I left the
house.</p>

<small>SHE VISITS H.M.S. &#8216;WARRIOR&#8217;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I remained</span> at home several days, seeing nobody,
waited upon by my maid and denying
myself to everybody. My aunt sent to
inquire after me, and my maid&#8217;s answers
satisfied her. I pulled the blinds down and
sat alone in my grief, with Tom&#8217;s miniature
upon my knee. But always at dusk I stole
forth and walked in the Old Bailey, close
against the walls of Newgate Prison, that I
might be near my dear one. I wrote to him
and took my chance of the letter reaching
his hands. I told him that no man was ever
more truly loved by his sweetheart; that
wherever he went I would go; and let them
send him where they would, he would find me
there; and I swore to him that he was innocent,
the victim of a monstrous, transparent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
conspiracy, and I said I prayed every night to
God to punish the villains who had brought
us to this miserable state.</p>

<p>It was about a fortnight after the trial
that one of my trustees, Captain Galloway,
asked me by letter for an appointment; he
presented himself with Captain Fairman, the
other trustee. They were both bluff, hearty
seamen of the old school, somewhat resembling
each other, though not connected. The
motive of their visit was to get me to give up
Tom. Captain Galloway had not forgotten
my treatment of his son, and talked with ill-advised
heat. He did not deny that he considered
Captain Butler guilty. I listened with
contempt at first, but this gave way to temper
which rose into wrath, and I fairly gave the
devil they had aroused within me his way.
When they had gone I caught sight of myself
in a mirror, and I looked as flaming and red
and swelling and breathless as any mad
murderess in a padded cell.</p>

<p>I guessed my aunt was at the bottom of
these captains&#8217; visits. She must have asked
Mr. Stanford to talk to me too; otherwise I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
doubt if he had dared venture it. Yet I
listened to the fellow patiently till he told me
that he spoke as the representative of my
mother on earth; that made me think of my
father and I started up. I meant no physical
violence though I was capable of it then, but
my manner of jumping up was so menacing
that he instantly started from his chair and
hastened out of the room, slamming the door
after him.</p>

<p>I would not trust my uncle to obtain news
of Tom. I knew that all interested in me
wished me to break off with my sweetheart,
and would hoodwink me if they could by
keeping me in ignorance that Tom had been
sent out of the country. A clerk named
Woolfe who had been in my uncle&#8217;s employ
had started for himself; he was a shrewd,
unscrupulous young dog. I bargained with
him to get me news of Tom, and to work all
methods of communication practicable by
bribery. From him I learned that my sweetheart
had been removed from Newgate to
Millbank. The fellow took a hundred guineas
from me in all, but did no more for the money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
than discover where Tom was; and one day,
about four months after Tom&#8217;s conviction,
this young rogue of a lawyer called upon me
at Stepney to say that Tom had been transferred
from Millbank to H.M.S. <i>Warrior</i> hulk,
moored off Woolwich Dockyard.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you sure?&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am now from Millbank,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;And what will happen next?&#8217; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;ll keep him at forced labour at the
dockyard,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;till a transport hauls
alongside the hulk for a cargo.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When will that be?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Impossible to say, miss.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will you get me the rules of the hulk?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They are the same as the jails.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I have not seen Captain Butler since
his conviction, nor heard from him, nor know
whether he has received my letters.&#8217;</p>

<p>He answered that he would make inquiries
and call. He was intelligibly punctual,
because he had to receive ten guineas, but
he brought me what I wanted to know, and
to my joy I learned that I was at liberty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
visit Tom next day, and that he would be
brought on board to see me if he was ashore
when I arrived.</p>

<p>The morning following I dressed with
care. I wore black clothes. I had worn
black ever since my sweetheart was taken
from me. I put on a black veil, and going
into the street, walked till I met with a coach,
and drove to Blackwall. I had not visited
those parts since Tom and I and the others
had seen Will Johnstone off, and I dared not
glance in the direction of the hotel in which
my sweetheart had made love to me and
asked me to marry him. Indeed, my heart
needed all the fortitude my spirit could
give it.</p>

<p>It was a bright, hot day. The sky was
high with delicate, frostlike cloud, and the
running river blue with the reflection of the
heavens. The wind was a light summer
breeze and blew from London, and many
ships of many rigs floated before it, some of
them lifting lofty fabrics of swelling breasts
of canvas, some of them dark with a weather-stained
look, like my father&#8217;s coasters. Here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
at Blackwall I took a boat, and told the man
to row me to the <i>Warrior</i> hulk.</p>

<p>&#8216;You know her?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He was an elderly man, dressed in a tall
hat and jersey; he exposed a few yellow fangs
as he lay back on his oars and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Know her? Yes. Know the <i>Warrior</i>!
Yah might as well ask me if I know St. Paul&#8217;s.
Going aboard?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Friend aboard?&#8217;</p>

<p>I inclined my head.</p>

<p>&#8216;I had a nevvey locked up in that there
hulk,&#8217; said the man. &#8216;He had six year.
Now&#8217;s out and doon well. He drove a light
cart drawn by a nag as could trot, and
called hisself a pig-dealer. Do &#8217;spectable
pig-dealers break into houses o&#8217; night? The
<i>Warrior</i> cured my nevvey. He ain&#8217;t above
talking of that ship. Get him in the mood,
and he&#8217;ll spin yah some queer yarns about
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How are the prisoners treated?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sights o&#8217; stone-breaking and stacking o&#8217;
timber. They put my nevvey to draw carts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
They sunk his name and caa&#8217;d him a number.
A man doan&#8217; feel a man when he&#8217;s a number.
But the job my nevvey least enjoyed was
scraping shot.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How are they fed?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;By contract. Yah knows what that
means. Beef all veins. Ever heard of
&#8220;smiggins,&#8221; miss?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s hulk soup: convicts&#8217; name for greasy
warm water. Call it twenty year ago, I was
passing a hulk stationed afore the <i>Defence</i>
came up; a boat was &#8217;longside with provisions
for the day; what d&#8217;ye think? With my own
eyes I see the prisoners as was hoisting the
grub out of the boat chuck it overboard.
Was they flogged?&#8217;</p>

<p>He shook his head, grinning horribly.</p>

<p>His manners and answers shocked and
depressed me, and I asked him no more
questions.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ain&#8217;t it rather sing&#8217;ler,&#8217; said he, after a
few minutes&#8217; pause, &#8216;that there&#8217;s only one
flower as &#8217;ll grow upon a convict&#8217;s grave?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that so?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>&#8216;Ay. And what flower d&#8217;ye think it is,
miss?&#8217; said he, again showing his fangs.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a nettle. If yah should care to visit
the burial-ground yonder,&#8217; he continued, with
a backward nod of his head in the direction
of Woolwich, &#8216;yah &#8217;ll see for yourself. As if
nothen would blow ower a convict but that!
Of course the finger o&#8217; nater&#8217;s in it. The
finger o&#8217; nater&#8217;s got the straight tip for most
jobs. It&#8217;s daisies for the likes of you and me,
and nettles for them as goes wrong.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was too agitated to converse with such
a heartless creature as this. My mind was
full of Tom. I wondered how he would greet
me&mdash;how I should find him looking. We
should be allowed but a quarter of an hour.
What time would that give me, to whom a
long summer day was all too brief in which
to tell him how I loved him; how I meant to
follow him; how our loyalty to one another
should, if God permitted, triumph yet over
the horrors and the sufferings which might
lie between the now and the hour of victorious
emergence!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>We were still about a mile from the hulk,
when I observed a large ship in tow of a tug
coming up the river. She sat deep in the
water and was plainly fresh from a long voyage,
rusty about the bows and weather-stained
along the line of her painted ports; but she
carried the smartness of a frigate aloft in the
well-squared yards, from which all canvas had
been unbent, and in the perfectly-stayed and
lofty topgallant-masts, whose royal yards had
been sent down. I seemed to recognise the
large house-flag she flew at the main.</p>

<p>&#8216;What ship is that?&#8217; I asked, well aware
that Thames watermen know every ship out
of London.</p>

<p>He turned his chin on his shoulder and
viewed her leisurely and answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Childe Harold</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Childe Harold</i>!&#8217; I cried, and I threw
up my veil to look at her. Will Johnstone&#8217;s
ship! I could scarcely credit my eyes. She
glided, stately and slow, in the wake of the
tug. Her home was at hand, the forest of
the East India Docks was in sight, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
paddles of the little steamer were beating the
water slowly.</p>

<p>I observed a crowd of people on the forecastle,
and a number of men and women
walked the poop, or after-deck. The red
flag streamed brightly from the peak, the
glass and brass about her sparkled, the little
circular windows in her side flashed like gems
as they took the sun, and the raiment of the
ladies fluttered in many tints. Here and there
a sailor was trotting aloft, and a man standing
high and conspicuously on the forecastle was
shouting, with one hand against his mouth, to
the tug. As the noble ship passed she made
a holiday picture of the water round about
her and the land on either hand. I stared
hard, hoping I might catch a sight of Will,
but the distance between was too wide to
enable me to distinguish faces.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no finer ship out of London,&#8217; said
the waterman. &#8216;She&#8217;s from Australey. That&#8217;s
where the gents yah&#8217;re going to visit are sent
to. If there&#8217;s naught but nettles to be
blowed out of dead convicts there&#8217;s blisterin&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
fine cities to be growed out of live ones.
I&#8217;m going to Australey myself some of these
here days&mdash;just to take a look &#8217;round&mdash;work
my way out and home again. A shilling a
month &#8217;ud do. I&#8217;m no sailor man.&#8217;</p>

<p>He sank into silence. The <i>Childe Harold</i>
floated away astern, and now right ahead of
us and near loomed the giant figure of the
prison-hulk <i>Warrior</i>, her head pointing toward
London. Another hulk lay moored close by.
All these hulks, those off the Arsenal, as well
as those off the Dockyard, were as familiar to
me as the fingers of my hand. Over and over
again had I passed them and looked at them
during my lonely pleasant jaunts upon the
river, but always with an incurious eye; but
a new, deep, fearful significance had now to
my gaze entered the grim and hideous fabric
of the mountainous <i>Warrior</i>. I viewed the
rows of ports savagely and massively grated,
and thought of the many eyes of crime and
suffering, of guilt&mdash;and, O my God! of innocence
too&mdash;which might have peered through
those metal meshes at the outside scene of
flowing river, with the spirit of liberty strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
in the speeding craft, in the flight of
the cloud, in the feathering of the hissing
ripple.</p>

<p>She was a hideous ship, horrible in her
suggestions of human crime and despair.
Rows of coarse convict linen fluttered betwixt
her pole masts, at the head of the foremost of
which streamed the long pennon of the State.
She was bulged up all about the bows with
rude band-box-like buildings; cowled ventilating-shafts
gaped above her decks; the dull
gleam of gilt and glass about her vast quarter-galleries
and stern affected the imagination as
a faded memorial of times when her sides
bristled with the black dogs of war, when her
copper sheathing trembled like a glance of
sunset under her, when she lifted star-searching
spires to the sky, space upon space of
symmetric whiteness swelling soft as sifted
snow to the glittering buttons of her trucks.</p>

<p>There was an off gangway ladder, with a
warder standing like a sentinel at the head of
it. The convicts were ashore, all of them,
saving a few, silent at their trades under deck.
A singular hush lay upon the big ship; though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the morning was advanced and wide and brilliant,
and the river alive with stemming barges
and row-boats and sailing craft of all sorts,
and alive too on the banks where the Dockyard
was, and higher, where were many low
wharves and dismantled hulks and riverside
public-houses, and higher yet, where the
Arsenal was, with its chimneys pouring smoke
and feathers of steam darting from great
square buildings; such was the stillness upon
this slumbering mass of prison hulk, that, as
we drew alongside, I could hear no sound but
the sob of the stream of tide washing along
the bends and an occasional groan of aged
timber as the sweep of the water strained the
old fabric upon its bed of mud.</p>

<p>I bade the waterman wait, got upon the
ladder, and ascended. The warder or officer
at the gangway inquired my business. I told
him I was a visitor come to see one of the
convicts, Thomas Butler. He bade me pass
on to the quarter-deck, where were assembled
two or three groups of persons who were also
arrived to visit friends. The people might
have come on board by way of a gallery<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
which connected the ship with the shore on
the port or left-hand side; this gallery was
defended under the forecastle by a huge iron
palisade with two strong gates for padlocking.</p>

<p>The warder at the gangway spoke to an
officer who stood within earshot. He crossed
the deck and the shore was hailed, but I know
not by whom nor heard what was said. I
had lifted my veil to look at the <i>Childe Harold</i>
and kept it up. My pulse throbbed fast, and
I knew I was very white, but my mood had
become resolved by temper. My heart turned
sick at the sight of the wide decks with their
grimy incumbrances of convicts and officers&#8217;
galleys and hammock-houses and other heaped
and sordid and filthy-looking structures. I
thought of Tom as an innocent man doomed
to soul-killing work ashore and heart-breaking
immurement in this hulk, locked up below at
night with hundreds of felons, many of whom
had been fetched by the hands of justice out
of the gutters and slums and rookeries of
that city whose atmosphere even in the far
distance tinged and tainted the blue of the
summer sky.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>I stood viewing the ship and wondering at
what part of her my sweetheart would appear.
A man came from the forward end, looking
from right to left with inspecting eyes as he
walked; he approached and lightly surveyed
me and the others who were waiting. He
was a strongly built man, dressed in a sort of
uniform frock coat decorated with a riband
and clasp; on his head was a large bell-shaped
cap like to what I have seen in pictures of
German and Russian officers. The expression
of his face was firm, but there was a colouring
of kindness in it. A glow of interest
kindled in his ball-like eyes, and saluting me
with a flourish of his hand to the peak of his
cap, he asked whom I had come to see.</p>

<p>&#8216;One of the convicts, Thomas Butler,&#8217; I
answered.</p>

<p>He stepped over to a warder, then returned.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you his wife, madam?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am his sweetheart and engaged to be
married to him,&#8217; I said, colouring, and raised
my hand to my veil, though I left my face
exposed, nevertheless.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; he exclaimed, with a sigh of
pity.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is innocent, sir. Devils in the shape
of men have falsely sworn him into this dreadful
situation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They are all innocent who come here;
they are all innocent,&#8217; said he in a voice of
great irony.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you the captain of this ship, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This ship has no captain,&#8217; he answered,
smiling. &#8216;I am the deputy-governor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Butler is sentenced to fourteen
years&#8217; transportation; shall I know when he
sails?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The rules will allow him to communicate
with you. Our regulations are carried out
with great consideration. You observe that
if a friend calls while a man is away at labour,
he is sent for.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How often may I see Captain Butler?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Every three months.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, sir!&#8217; I clasped my hands and rocked
myself; then summoning my former spirit,
for I was eager to get all information possible
from this communicative and sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
personage, I said: &#8216;How often may I write to
him and he to me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Every three months,&#8217; he repeated, but
softly, with a glance at the waiting groups
who had insensibly stolen toward us to
listen.</p>

<p>&#8216;He may sail within the next three months,
and I shall not know where he is gone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The regulations will permit of his communicating
with you through the governor
before he sails, and you will be allowed to bid
him farewell.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And will he be able to tell me to what
part of the world he is to be sent?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s not always known at the Admiralty,
down, sometimes, to the last minute. A
convict ship has before now brought up in
the Downs bound to Hobart Town or Norfolk
Island, and her destination has been changed
by express to Botany Bay.&#8217;</p>

<p>He touched his cap with a slight bow
having thus spoken, and crossed to the other
waiting poor folks as though willing to be
questioned.</p>

<p>I paced a little space of the deck. I could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
have held him long in converse; I had, methought,
a thousand questions to ask. On a
sudden, happening to look along the deck to
the left, I saw a number of men appear.
Some of them were convicts and the others
were the guard. They came into the ship by
the gallery that stretched from the quay to
the gangway. The convicts were dressed in
a rusty brown suit with red stripes upon it;
they all looked alike, so horribly levelling is
the garb of the felon. A woman who was
waiting shrieked out and ran some steps,
and a little boy of ten or twelve, whose
hand was grasped by a young woman, called
out:</p>

<p>&#8216;Father! Father!&#8217; and began to cry
piteously, still calling: &#8216;Father! Father!&#8217;</p>

<p>The warders came to a pause near the
hatch. There were four convicts; three of
them were embraced by the women who had
been waiting, the little boy meanwhile continuing
to cry loudly, and two of the women
sobbing piteously; the fourth advanced and
paused with his eyes upon me.</p>

<p>It was Tom, but for a few minutes I did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
not know him. His face was a fiery red and
wet with sweat, as though he had been
brought fresh from some exhausting labour;
his hair was closely cut, and his beard was
cleanly shaved. The loathsome garb had as
utterly transformed him as though he had
been wrapped in the shroud of the dead. I
cried his name and fled to him. He locked
me in his arms, and so we stood for a little
while speechless.</p>

<p>&#8216;My Marian!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Tom, time is precious and I have
much to say! Have you received any letters
from me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;None.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have written to you often. Why did
they not give you my letters? But you
would not think because you did not hear
from me that I was forgetting you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you heard from me, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have written. But a prison-governor
may stop a felon&#8217;s letters, and mine have been
stopped, and they have not given me yours.
We may have written too strongly.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>He started and looked at me a little wildly
and cried:</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, why are you here? This atmosphere
is pollution. Look at my dress; look
at these hands. I have worn chains; I am
driven as though I were a mad and dangerous
beast; I am herded with ruffians, and I am
innocent! I swear by your pure heart,
Marian, I am guiltless of the crime for which
they have put me into this ship and for which
they send me ashore by day to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash; Why
are you here, dear?&#8217; he cried, still wildly, and
now a little incoherently. &#8216;They have hellishly
sworn me, innocent as I am, into this.
They have made a felon of me. They are
sending me from my country, and my heart
must break&mdash;my heart must break!&#8217; he said,
sobbing convulsively. &#8216;And they will bury
me in a convict&#8217;s grave. Oh, Marian, it is at
an end between us&mdash;it must be so. I am a
convict, ruined and for ever dishonoured.
Look at me!&#8217;</p>

<p>My heart was bursting whilst I listened to
him, but the great God, who knew that my
sweetheart was a cruelly and terribly wronged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
man, gave me, of His mercy, heart and spirit.
I had much to say, and the moments were
flying. I looked at him with a smile and
grasped his hand in both mine. He struggled
faintly, but I continued to hold his hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, you are not dishonoured, you are
not ruined. You are wronged. Only that,
my darling; no more. Hear me, dear,&#8217; and I
softened my voice, for I was sensible of the
deep thrill of my earnestness in every syllable
that fell from me. &#8216;I have come to tell you
that my love is unchangeable; that my love
for you now is sanctified by your misery, and
that it is deeper, truer and holier, Tom, than
ever it was before. Oh, hear me, love, and
take heart! Wherever you go, I will go. I
shall learn where they send you and accompany
you or follow you. Nothing but death
can separate us. I have walked night after
night beside the prison walls that I might be
near you, and whilst you are here I shall be
near you. They cannot separate us. Always
believe, always know, that whilst you are in
this ship&mdash;yes, whilst they are trying to break
your heart ashore&mdash;I am present&mdash;oh, not in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
sympathy, not in love, not in spirit only, Tom,
but near you, but close as they will let me be
to you in my own person. Does that comfort
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>He lifted my hand and bowed his head
upon it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Something may happen at any time to
prove your innocence,&#8217; I continued.</p>

<p>&#8216;What could happen, Marian? Will Rotch
ever admit that he perjured himself merely to
get charge of my ship and to punish me for
reporting him and for my treatment of him at
Valparaiso?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But your banishment is not for life,
Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is! It is!&#8217; he cried. &#8216;Who ever
returns from transportation?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They will give you your liberty after a
time; you will be free, and I shall be with
you. I have money, and we will establish
ourselves and be happy, my darling.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My noble heart, your love breaks me
down!&#8217; he cried, looking up and grasping me
by the hands, then covering his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was talking with a man before you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
came, Tom. He is the deputy-governor.
Yonder he stands. He tells me that you will
be allowed to write and inform me when you
are to sail. You will receive the news and
have leave to convey it. Will you do so?&#8217;</p>

<p>He viewed me in a shrinking way.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Tom, Tom, you must swear to write
to me!&#8217; I cried in a sudden fit of despair.
&#8216;Swear it! If you do not write, how shall I
know when you have gone and where you
have gone? Swear you will write! Swear it!
Swear it!&#8217; I clutched him by the arm in my
passion of eagerness and desire, repeating:
&#8216;Swear it!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You must not follow me. You must not
leave your home for me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Swear it, Tom!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall be a servant, a slave out in Australia,
a convict always, whether freed or
not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, swear it, Tom!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They may flog me&mdash;chain me in a gang&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Swear to write and tell me when you
sail.&#8217;</p>

<p>He was silent, breathed deeply, then his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
eyes lighted up with love, and he exclaimed
in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8216;I swear it!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would it be for you to divide us, Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>He faintly smiled and answered:</p>

<p>&#8216;You know me to be innocent, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, as I am of that crime they have
charged you with.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do they say of me? What is
thought?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, what does it matter? You are
innocent, and I love you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My noble heart, God bless you. What
does your uncle think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Time&#8217;s up?&#8217; cried a warder.</p>

<p>&#8216;You have sworn it, Tom. Remember!&#8216;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will write, dearest, I swear it, I will
write.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come, my man!&#8217; shouted one of the
guard.</p>

<p>&#8216;Remember, Tom!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will write to you,&#8217; were his last words.</p>

<p>I stood watching him as he walked with
the other convicts and the guard to the gangway
gallery. The excitement and grief of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
this meeting worked like a fever in me. My
breast was violently heaving, my eyes were
dry and hot, as though full of fire, my lips
parched as though pale and broken with
thirst. I stepped over to the deputy-governor
and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Will money help a man in this ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, madam,&#8217; said he shortly, eyeing me
with a look of grave surprise.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will send fifty pounds to you or the
governor, and as much again when that
money is spent, to furnish Thomas Butler
with comforts outside the horrible prison
fare.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Gently, madam. The prison fare is not
so horrible as you think. Many get such
food here as they never see out of jail and
never get money enough to purchase after
their discharge. Cocoa, bread, beef, soup&mdash;such
food is not horrible. But the wealth of
the Indies would not help your friend in this
hulk.&#8217;</p>

<p>I bowed to him, dropped my veil, went
to the side and entered the wherry. The
waterman began to talk; to this moment I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
believe it was he and not his nephew who
had been a convict. I kept my lips sealed,
and the man sank into silence whilst he
rowed steadily in the direction of Blackwall.
When we turned a bend so as to get a sight
of the docks, I spied the <i>Childe Harold</i> lying
athwart the stream, with her head close in to
the dock entrance. The waterman looked at
her and said he guessed she was hindered by
some difficulty of the tide. Addressing the
fellow for the first time, I bade him pull close
under the stern of the ship, as I desired to
hail her. I stared anxiously as we approached,
thinking I might see Will Johnstone.
A number of men were travelling
round a capstan on the forecastle, and a
hurricane chorus swept in regular pauses
from their lungs as the pawls clanked to the
thrust of the handspikes. A knot of people
were gathered on the pier-head; a few figures
walked the poop-deck.</p>

<p>We pulled close under the stern of the
ship where the water was sparkling in diamonds
and trembling in gold to the windy
flash and the ruddy gleam of the sun-touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
windows and the gilt work, and on looking
up I saw no less a person than my cousin
Will himself in the act of handling the peak
signal halliards to clear the ensign.</p>

<p>I cried out, &#8216;Will, Will, is that you,
Will?&#8217; and threw up my veil.</p>

<p>He heard me and looked over, and after
staring an instant full of wonder, he violently
clapped his hands with boyish joy, and
shouted down: &#8216;Why, Marian, is that you?
Have you come off to meet me? How kind
of you! How&#8217;s mother? How&#8217;s father?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They are well, Will; they are very well.
How brown you are! You are as broad and
tall again as you were.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You look very white down there, Marian.
Come on board and give me all the news.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I cannot come on board. I shall be
seeing you very soon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How is Captain Butler? Are you married
yet, Marian? Oh, there&#8217;s a lot for me to
hear! I haven&#8217;t had a syllable of home news
since we left Sydney. We&#8217;ve made a ripping
passage home&mdash;seventy-eight days from
Sydney Heads to Soundings.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>&#8216;When shall I see you, dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The moment the ship&#8217;s in dock I&#8217;ll go
home. Father can&#8217;t have heard that the
ship&#8217;s in the river, or he or mother would
be here to meet me, wouldn&#8217;t they? If
you&#8217;re going straight ashore, Marian, and &#8217;ll
be seeing them soon, tell &#8217;em I shall be home
this afternoon, and &#8217;ll be glad of a good blow-out&mdash;roast
beef to be the main thing; I don&#8217;t
care what they surround it with. I&#8217;m stiff
with the brine of the harness cask. Is
Captain Butler in England?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You shall have all the news when I see
you at my house, Will. You are busy now.
We&#8217;ll meet to-morrow, Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To-night, to-night, Marian! I have a
hundred fine yarns to spin you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thank God you are safely returned,&#8217;
said I, and kissing my hand to him, I sank
into my seat, and the boatman plied his oars.</p>

<p>&#8216;Fine young gent, that,&#8217; said the boatman,
&#8216;but a first voyager, I lay. Them young
gents is all for eating after the first voyage;
after the second they&#8217;s all for drinking. And
who&#8217;s a-going to blame &#8217;em?&#8217; said he, smacking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
his lips. &#8216;Didn&#8217;t Noah himself take to
drink after a few weeks of the Ark&mdash;and
yon&#8217;s a nine months&#8217; job.&#8217;</p>

<p>I paid the man, landed, walked till I came
to a coach and drove to Stepney. I remained
alone and at home for the remainder of the
day. My heart ached, and sometimes I wept;
yet I was thankful to have seen Tom, thankful
to know he was sure now that I was
faithful to him, thankful for all that had
passed between us, few as our words had
been. In the evening I received a note from
my aunt telling me that Will was returned,
and begging me to come to supper. I sent
word by the messenger that I was low and
poorly, and hoped to see Will at my house
very soon.</p>

<small>SHE RAMBLES WITH HER COUSIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I breakfasted</span> somewhat late next morning,
and whilst the cloth was still on the table
my maid announced Will. I sprang up to
greet him and gave him a hearty hug. He
had grown during his absence into a handsome,
fine young fellow. His eyes seemed to
sparkle with the gleams of the sea; he was
coloured a rich, manly brown, and no young
fellow that ever I remember had so completely
the look of a saucy and spirited young English
sailor. The sight of him so near, and in
my room, dimmed my eyes. I thought of
our holiday rambles when Tom was by my
side, when all was music and laughter and
the sweetness of flowers, and sleep filled with
soft dreams.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mother and father met me, after all,
Marian,&#8217; said he, throwing his cap on to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
sofa. &#8216;They are waiting for me at the ship&#8217;s
berth. But what terrible news! Poor
Marian!&#8217; And in the fulness of his heart,
unable to say more just then, he came across
and kissed me. I sobbed aloud even while I
felt the comfort of his sympathy. &#8216;But he
never did it, Marian. Father told me the
whole story. They&#8217;ve got a paper containing
the trial at home, and I read it carefully
through last night. Rotch and Nodder are
villains. If Captain Butler had been tried by
a judge and jury of sailors he&#8217;d have been
acquitted.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s as innocent as you, Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And sentenced to fourteen years&#8217; transportation!
Why, that&#8217;s almost a life-sentence
at his age. Where is he now?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In the <i>Warrior</i> hulk, off Woolwich.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Were you coming from him when I saw
you yesterday?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor Marian! Father fears he&#8217;s guilty;
but he&#8217;s not&mdash;I&#8217;ll swear it. Why, I have his
face before me now,&#8217; he cried with his eyes
kindling. &#8216;He could not do a wrong. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
how he loved you, Marian! But what&#8217;s to
be done?&#8217; He walked with a rolling gait
about the room. &#8216;I&#8217;d do anything to make
you happy. Little I guessed what had happened
when I asked you yesterday if you
were married to him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall follow him to Australia, Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mother says that&#8217;s your idea. But what
will you do when you get there? He&#8217;ll be
as much a prisoner in Australia as here,
won&#8217;t he?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. I&#8217;ve read and found out. I&#8217;ve
learned all I wanted to know from Mr. Woolfe,&#8217;
said I, naming the sharp young attorney that
had been a clerk to my uncle. &#8216;Certainly, a
man is still a convict when he arrives, and he
remains a convict; but he&#8217;s not locked up in
hulks and jails. The Government puts the
men into barracks when they arrive, and
lends them out to those who want labourers
and servants and help. Tom will rank as a
gentleman convict; he&#8217;s good with his pen
and he&#8217;s a scholar, Will; they may make him
a clerk. He is not a mechanic, and he&#8217;s too
good to send to the roads.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>&#8216;How do you know all this, old woman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know very much more, Will,&#8217; said I,
smiling in my sadness. &#8216;Could I love Tom
and not learn all that lies before him as
though I was to share it? If they would
put me to work in the dockyard by his side,
how happy I should be! If they&#8217;d but lock
me up in that horrible hulk with him&mdash;but
they&#8217;ll not be able to separate us, Will. Oh,
I have a fine scheme! When he sails I&#8217;ll
follow in the next ship. I have money, and
I&#8217;ll establish myself, and I&#8217;ll ask for a servant,
and bribe and bribe until I get Tom, and if I
fail I am still near him. They may give him
a ticket-of-leave quickly; they must give him
a ticket-of-leave in six years if he behaves
well. If&mdash;if&mdash;but oh, he&#8217;ll behave well!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How your eyes flash! You&#8217;re as red as
fire! You&#8217;ve got a magnificent spirit! I
always said so. You&#8217;re a splendid woman,
and you&#8217;ll make it right for both of you,
yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is my scheme wicked?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it wrong for a woman who loves a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
man to be true to him to the grave, let what
will happen before death?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is right!&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Uncle would have me break with Tom.
So would aunt. Tom is first with me after
my God.&#8217;</p>

<p>He clapped his hands and hurrahed like
a boy.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can I see him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not for another three months.&#8217;</p>

<p>He struck his knee with his fist and
smothered a sea oath.</p>

<p>This sort of talk, however, was no very
cheery welcome on my part to the poor lad;
so I presently got him to tell me about his
voyage and how he liked the sea, and when
he was again to sail, and I then gave him five
pounds which I had put aside for him; his
father, though a hospitable man, kept Will a
little short. I wished the boy, after his long
months at sea, to pass a jolly holiday, and
told him when he kissed and thanked me,
that another five should be his when that was
spent.</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll go a-rambling again, Marian,&#8217; said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
he. &#8216;Those were fine times. You&#8217;re white
with trouble, and some of those milk and
buttercup trips we used to take will do you
good.&#8217;</p>

<p>I sighed and made no answer. He went
to Tom&#8217;s miniature and stood looking at it;
then began to talk again with eagerness and
enthusiasm about my scheme of following my
sweetheart.</p>

<p>&#8216;And why shouldn&#8217;t you go?&#8217; said he,
pacing the room. &#8216;You&#8217;re alone in the
world, and Tom&#8217;s first and everything to you.
Father and mother won&#8217;t like your going,
and you&#8217;ll be sorry to leave them, but they&#8217;re
not your parents. Tom&#8217;s all in all. If I
loved a girl as you love Tom she&#8217;d be all in
all to me, and I&#8217;d follow her whilst a stick
lasted, till the plank grew as thin as a sailor&#8217;s
shirt. But there&#8217;s this in my mind, Marian&mdash;before
you start in pursuit, you must know
where Captain Butler has been sent to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll know and tell me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose he should be sent to Hobart
Town and you make sail to Sydney, believing
him there? You don&#8217;t know how big all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
part of the world is. There&#8217;s a story of an
Irishman who bought a commission in the
71st in order that he might be near his
brother in the 70th. Have you got an atlas?
Hobart Town&#8217;s a mighty long way from
Botany Bay.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll tell me the settlement.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But suppose it should be Norfolk Island?
One of our Jacks knew that settlement. The
frightfulest ruffians go there. The sailor said
that when the convicts are removed they&#8217;re
double cross ironed and chained down to
the deck. Everybody&#8217;s afraid of them.
Now what would you do there in a settlement
of a few troops and scores of horrible
villains?&#8217;</p>

<p>I smiled and said: &#8216;Where Tom is sent,
I go;&#8217; and then starting up, and flashing
upon him in my old hot-tempered impulsive
fashion, I cried: &#8216;I know all about Norfolk
Island; I shall know what to do, Will.&#8217; I
sobered my voice and added, &#8216;I have been
scheming for months all alone, dear. All the
while that my darling has been in jail I have
been planning and planning. I care not what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
the settlement be; let me have its name and
I am ready.&#8217;</p>

<p>Will stayed an hour talking with me in
my rooms. He then made me put on my
hat and go for a walk.</p>

<p>From this time we were as often together
as though we had been brother and sister
and lived in the same house. His company
wonderfully cheered and supported me. I
loved him for his affectionate sympathy;
above all for his seeing things just as I did.
On this account I was more frequently at my
aunt&#8217;s than before his return from sea. She
and my uncle sometimes talked of Tom, but
never now in a way to vex me. They both
knew my character; they witnessed the faith
and devotion in my face whenever my sweetheart&#8217;s
name was pronounced; they had
gathered with the utmost significance from
Will what my intention was when Tom should
be sent across the seas, and saw the hopelessness
of entreaty. Indeed, I was my own
mistress. I was of age; I was answerable to
no one. They knew all this and held their
peace, though both of them, and my aunt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
especially, were secretly very uneasy and
distressed by my loyalty to a convict.</p>

<p>I had told Tom that I would be near him
in person, and once I had a mind to take a
lodging in Woolwich; but Stepney was not
too far distant to enable me to easily satisfy
my craving and fulfil my promise to be near
him often; moreover, I never knew from day
to day when I might hear that he was to be
transhipped, and I wished to be ready to
swiftly complete all my arrangements to
follow him. And that is why I remained at
home in Stepney instead of taking a lodging
near the dockyard at Woolwich, though over
and over again, sometimes four and sometimes
five times a week, would I hire a boat
and hang about the <i>Warrior</i> hulk.</p>

<p>Mr. Woolfe had got me the regulations of
the prison ship; I knew at what time the
convicts went ashore to their forced labour,
the hour they returned to dinner, when they
returned again to their tea or supper, and at
what time the hatches were put over them
and padlocked for the night. Indeed, I could
say off the regulations and every article in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the list of the prison fare by heart, and I
lived in imagination in the horrid routine of
the ship.</p>

<p>I once had a burning desire to visit the
huge hulk at night when all the people were
at rest in their hammocks within her and the
hatches on. I had plenty of spirit as a young
woman, and was, on the whole, a fearless
young creature; but I own I shrank from
trusting myself alone in a wherry at night on
the Thames with one of the watermen of those
times. I asked Will if he would accompany
me. He cheerfully consented, and I arranged
with a fellow at Wapping to await us at
Blackwall, to save the circuit at Limehouse
and Greenwich Reaches.</p>

<p>It was a night about the middle of September,
somewhat cold, but not uncomfortably
so. We reached the hulk, and lay off
her close in, the waterman quietly plying to
keep his boat steady in the stream. The sky
was dim and the stars gleamed sparely; there
was just weight enough of wind to run the
water sobbing along the bends of the towering,
motionless old seventy-four. The shore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
was dotted with spots of light, and under
every one of them a thread of gold wavered
like a wriggling eel striking for the depths.
The deep hush of the night lay sensibly as
the darkness itself upon the flat marshes of
Plumstead and across the river where the
Plaistow level stretched. The passing ships
went by silent as shadows. Now and again
a man&#8217;s voice would sound aboard one of
them; I&#8217;d hear the rumbling of a yard suddenly
let go or the rattling of the hanks of
canvas leisurely hoisting. Here and there
the grated ports of the hulk showed in a
square of dim light, but even as I watched a
clear-tongued bell on board was twice struck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nine o&#8217;clock,&#8217; said Will, and as though
a cloud had passed over the huge fabric every
light went out; the white bands of the
checkered sides seemed to hover out upon
the eye&mdash;pallid and ghastly with their wild
grin of grated ports; the pole masts died out
away up in the gloom.</p>

<p>&#8216;How many convicts are there aboard?&#8217;
asked Will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>&#8216;Over four hundred, sir,&#8217; answered the
waterman.</p>

<p>The lad seemed awed by the thought of
that number. Not yet would sleep have
visited the weariest of those eyes within,
and the fancy of the mass of human suffering
and crime and sorrow lying mute and awake,
with no other sound about the ship than the
sob of running water, made the silence of her
awful. I stood up, and my heart gave away
in a cry of passion and misery, and scarcely
sensible of what I did I extended my arms
toward the hulk and moaned:</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Tom! Oh, Tom! Why were you
taken from me? What has been your sin
that you should be there?&#8217; and then I broke
into a strangled fit of crying.</p>

<p>Will pulled me gently on to a seat and
fondled me and told me to keep up my
courage, for that I had spirit enough to bring
things right.</p>

<p>&#8216;Boat, ahoy! What boat is that?&#8217; was
shouted from the gangway of the hulk.</p>

<p>The waterman answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>&#8216;Shove ahead with you!&#8217; cried the voice.
&#8216;No boats are allowed to lie off here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pull for Blackwall,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;And time, too,&#8217; said the waterman as
he swept the boat&#8217;s head around. &#8216;They&#8217;re
armed with loaded carbines up there, and
they&#8217;d make no more of sending a ball
through a man&#8217;s head than drinkin&#8217; his
health.&#8217;</p>

<small>SHE CONCEIVES A STRANGE IDEA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Friday, October 18, I went to drink tea
and sup with my aunt, whom I had not
visited nor indeed seen for nearly a fortnight.
Whilst we sat at tea, my uncle being present,
Will came into the room; his manner was
rather excited, he entered with some vehemence,
and looking around at us cried out:</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What?&#8217; asked my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;The tender of the owners of the <i>Childe
Harold</i> has been accepted, and we are to load
convicts for one of the settlements early next
month.&#8217;</p>

<p>I started, then sat motionless, feeling my
cheeks bloodless.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who told you this?&#8217; said my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Bates. I met him in the Minories.
He only got the news this afternoon.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>&#8216;Convicts?&#8217; said my aunt. &#8216;I don&#8217;t like
the idea of your going out in a convict ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Safe as the Bank of England,&#8217; said my
uncle. &#8216;They carry plenty of soldiers, plenty
of sailors, and a large freight of handcuffs and
irons. What more would you have?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose Captain Butler should be put
into our ship!&#8217; exclaimed Will, looking at me.</p>

<p>I could not make him any answer then.</p>

<p>&#8216;The chances are a hundred to one against
such a probability,&#8217; exclaimed my uncle. &#8216;It
is a big convict ship that takes out three
hundred felons. How many have you aboard
the Thames&#8217;s hulks alone? Not less than
one thousand, I dare say. Then batches are
picked up at Portsmouth and Plymouth.
Consider the odds. Besides, Butler has served
no time in the hulks. Yet it would be extraordinary
should it come to pass,&#8217; he added
musingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;The ship goes to Deptford to be equipped&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know when,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will the <i>Childe Harold</i> be the only convict
ship of her date?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s to be found out,&#8217; said Will.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>&#8216;I&#8217;ll find out!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why do you ask, Marian?&#8217; said my slow-minded
aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom is to tell me when he sails,&#8217; I
replied. &#8216;If his date is to be the <i>Childe
Harold&#8217;s</i> date, and if there should be no other
vessel, Will&#8217;s ship will be Tom&#8217;s ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>My aunt averted her face as though annoyed
by my coupling Will with Tom in the
same breath.</p>

<p>Having begun to talk, I continued; and
our conversation for some time was all about
the <i>Childe Harold</i> and convict ships. My
uncle knew a good deal about this sort of
vessel. Long association with seafaring
people had taught him much that is not
commonly known to lawyers. He explained
that ships chartered for convicts often went
to Deptford to fit out. The lower decks
were cleared fore and aft; strong bulkheads
of oak, frequently loopholed for muskets,
erected; hatchway openings strongly
railed and protected; bed-boards set up in
tiers within the whole length of the prison,
after the manner of a soldiers&#8217; guard-room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>&#8216;I dare say,&#8217; said he, &#8216;the <i>Childe Harold</i>
will get about five pounds a ton. Not bad
pay, as times go. The captain receives so
much a head for every man delivered in the
colony. This makes him careful. Formerly,
the skipper took the job in the lump, and the
more deaths during the voyage the better,
because deaths saved victuals. If Butler
wants to sail I hope he&#8217;s pretty well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;ll carry no sickly convicts to sea,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;The surgeon inspects the fellows
and rejects those whom he considers unfit for
the voyage. But they&#8217;re mostly so wild to
get transported that they&#8217;d cheat Old Nick
himself; and I&#8217;ve heard of surgeons being
humbugged into taking men who died before
the Scillys were fairly astern.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom, when I saw him,&#8217; said I, &#8216;was as
strong and well as it was possible for a man
to be who is everyday put to killing work.&#8217;</p>

<p>My aunt eyed me askant; my uncle softly
drummed upon the table and then suddenly
burst into a speech on the delights of transportation.
He felt strongly on this point.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
He said he knew of country labourers who
had called upon the parson of the parish to
know what crime they could commit to insure
their being transported.</p>

<p>&#8216;Letters are read in village ale-houses,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;from rogues who are making money
and doing well in New South Wales or Tasmania.
The writers hail from the district,
and they tell their friends how Bob, whom
the country-side knows and who was transported
for burglary, is receiving a hundred
a year as tapster at a tavern, and how Bill,
who was lagged for stealing wheat, has taken
a large farm near Sydney. Transportation
ought to increase crime in this country. I
am not surprised that the people of Australia
should be apprehensive that morality is on
the increase amongst us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How do the respectable people out there,&#8217;
inquired my aunt, &#8216;relish our turning their
country into a dustbin for our own vile sweepings
and offal?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The system&#8217;s liked. We send them
labour for nothing. Labour they must have,
and they get it free. In the West Indies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
they have to pay handsomely for slaves; in
the colonies the slaves called convicts cost
their masters nothing but their keep.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let us change the subject,&#8217; said my aunt;
&#8216;really all this talk of convicts and transportation
makes me feel as if one was just out
of jail oneself. I wish they would give Will
another vessel. I do not at all like the idea
of a convict ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pshaw!&#8217; exclaimed my uncle, and left
the room.</p>

<p>Next day I called upon Mr. Woolfe and
requested him carefully to ascertain what or
how many ships had been accepted by tender
for the transport of criminals between this
and a date I named to him. I promised him
a handsome fee if he could accurately find
this out for me. I don&#8217;t know how he went
to work; probably he obtained his information
direct from the Admiralty; I did not inquire.
But in a few days he managed to
learn all I desired to know, and without my
having told him that I was aware the <i>Childe
Harold&#8217;s</i> tender had been accepted, he informed
me that the only transport taken up,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
the only ship, indeed, whose services were
required down to the end of the year, was
the <i>Childe Harold</i>, and that Government
would not call for further tenders till the
following spring.</p>

<p>I came down one morning to breakfast,
and the first thing I saw lying upon my table
was a peculiar-looking letter. I snatched it
up, and instantly saw that the handwriting
was Tom&#8217;s. It was not three months since I
had visited him, and therefore I instinctively
guessed that he was about to be removed, and
that leave had been granted him to communicate
with his friends. It was a supreme
moment; it was a crisis in my life. My
hand shook; I could scarcely open the letter.
It was a prison sheet, with certain jail-rules
of which I forget the nature printed in a
corner. The letter ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8216;<span class="smcap">My dear Marian</span>: I am permitted to
write that I may inform you I have been
told by the governor I am to make one of a
batch of convicts to be removed from this
hulk for transportation to Hobart Town, Van<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
Diemen&#8217;s Land, by a ship sailing on or about
November 12. I hope you are quite well.
I am tolerably so. I have nothing to complain
of, but I shall be glad when the time
comes for our departure. The rules will permit
you to pay me a visit to bid me farewell.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright">&#8216;Yours affectionately,</span><br />
&#8216;<span class="smcap">Thomas Butler</span>.&#8217;
</p></div>

<p>I easily understood the meaning of the
cold, formal style of this letter. A single
injudicious sentence might have caused the
governor, through whose hands it passed, to
withhold or destroy it. Tom was right; he
could not deliver himself too briefly and dispassionately.</p>

<p>I read this letter a dozen times over and
kissed it as often. It seemed that an extraordinary
coincidence was about to happen;
I mean that the vessel in which Will was an
apprentice was to prove the very ship which
would carry Tom across the seas. I was
strangely agitated; in a manner semi-delirious
with the sudden wild play and
disorder of my spirits. Tom was to be transported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
to Van Diemen&#8217;s Land. I would follow
him. I would immediately find out if
any vessel was sailing for Hobart on or about
the date of the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> departure.
But, then, suppose the destination of the
<i>Childe Harold</i> should be changed without
my knowing it! Or suppose she should sail
without Tom, whilst I, not guessing this,
should be on my way to the ends of the
earth, thinking to find him there!</p>

<p>I read the letter again. I paced the room
as though I had gone mad. My maid put
the breakfast on the table, but I could not
look at food. Why, how could I be sure of
my ever meeting Tom again, of my ever
seeing him or hearing of him, indeed, if I did
not go out in the same ship with him, if I
was not certain that he was not one of the
convicts on board?</p>

<p>How was this to be done? I bitterly well
knew that no passengers were received in
Government felon transports? Could I obtain
a berth in the <i>Childe Harold</i> as stewardess?
Was there any sort of post aboard her that
I, as a woman, was qualified to fill?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>Whilst I thus thought, half distracted by
the hurry and confusion my mind was in, I
stopped at the window and, looking out, saw
a young sailor walking on the pavement opposite.
He was dressed in pilot cloth and a
cloth cap, and was a very pretty lad; perhaps
sixteen years old; something girlish in
his looks, however, his hair being of a pale
gold, his figure thin and his face without
colour. He came to a stand, with his face my
way, and laughed at something that was happening
under my window; perhaps a dog
fight, but I was too full of thought to take
notice of the noise of the curs. My eye dwelt
upon the pretty lad with a sort of pleasure.
He looked up and saw me, and kissed his
hand, but so girlishly and childishly that,
though I instantly drew back, I did not somehow
feel offended. When I peered again he
was gone.</p>

<p>All on a sudden an extraordinary idea
entered my head. It had been put into it by
the sight of that girlish-looking sailor lad.
I set off pacing the room afresh, frowning,
talking aloud to myself, halting to smite my
hands together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>&#8216;It is to be done!&#8217; I kept on thinking.
&#8216;It will be the surest and the only way!
Why did not I think of it at once?&#8217;</p>

<p>And then I placed myself opposite a long
glass that reached to the floor and surveyed
my figure, turning myself on this side and
then on that. My eyes shone. My cheeks
were as full of colour as though I had been
burnt by the sun. I lifted my dress to clear
my ankles, and stepped backward and forward
before the mirror, imitating as best I
could the peculiar rolling gait I had always
admired in Tom.</p>

<p>I had arranged with my cousin to take a
plain dinner with me at one o&#8217;clock, and we
were then to take a turn in the West End.
But for this having been settled, I must have
sought him at his house at once, and traced
him to wherever he might have gone, so
crazy was I with the eagerness and hope my
extraordinary, startling idea had raised in me.
I could not bear to sit alone; never did time
pass so slowly; I&#8217;d look at the clock and find
that only a few minutes had passed, when I
could swear that half an hour was gone.</p>

<p>I put on my hat and walked toward Whitechapel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
and paused at the window of every
marine outfitter&#8217;s shop I came to. From one
of these shops a black-looking fellow with a
great hooked nose and a white hat stepped
forth and accosted me in a thick lisp. He
asked me what I would like to buy. I
pointed to a monkey jacket in his window,
and inquired the price. He said I should
have it, a bargain, and named four pounds.
I was moving on, when he begged me not to
be in a hurry. Would I give three pounds
ten shillings? I told him that I did not wish
to buy; he followed me a considerable distance,
lisping first in one ear and then in the
other:</p>

<p>&#8216;Vhat vould you give? Vould you give
three pounds? Vould you give fifty bob
and an old dress? Have you any old shilver
to exchange or shell?&#8217;</p>

<p>He quitted me at last; but though I
looked into other outfitters&#8217; shops, I asked
no more questions.</p>

<p>When I reached home, I found that my
cousin had arrived. I ran up to him, and
exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>&#8216;Will, I have heard from Tom! Read
the letter! Here it is! It reached me this
morning!&#8217;</p>

<p>He said with a grimace:</p>

<p>&#8216;The very paper they make them use has
an Old Bailey look.&#8217; He then read the letter,
and cried out: &#8216;Why, Marian, this seems as
though we were to take him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yours is the only ship, Will. I am certain
Tom will go with you. Is it not extraordinary?&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked at the letter again and said:</p>

<p>&#8216;The dates tally. I was at the office of
the owners yesterday, and I learn that we
sail about the 12th. But Tom speaks here
of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land. That&#8217;s certainly not
known at the office. I asked the question,
and they said it was not known whether it
was to be Launceston or Hobart Town or
Sydney.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It will be all the same,&#8217; I replied, &#8216;so
long as he goes in your ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope it won&#8217;t be to Norfolk Island, for
his sake. You look strange, Marian. What&#8217;s
put all that fire into your eyes? And you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
breathe as if you&#8217;d been running. Tom&#8217;s
letter has upset you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It has done me so much good that I feel
almost a child again, Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took the letter from me to look at it,
as though my words had made him doubt
that he had gathered its import.</p>

<p>&#8216;But, Marian,&#8217; said he, &#8216;he&#8217;ll be leaving
the country next month.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t that separation? I mean, it&#8217;s not
like having him within reach of even a three-month
visit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;ll be no separation,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You really mean to follow him?&#8217; I
viewed him steadily without speaking.
&#8216;Alone, as you are?&#8217; he continued. &#8216;All
the way to the other side of the world,
where you haven&#8217;t a friend and where the
chances are&mdash;the chances are&mdash;&#8217; he repeated
slowly, then paused and cried out: &#8216;Why,
yes, you have the love and spirit to do it,
and when done it will be nobly done, to my
way of thinking. But it will be like making
a felon of yourself, Marian.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>I put my hand on his shoulder and looked
him in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;You know, Will, I couldn&#8217;t live separated
from Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t stare so. What eyes you have!
Do they shine in the dark?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is an innocent, suffering man, and I
am as much his wife at heart as though his
wedding-ring were on my finger. I mean to
do more than follow him. If he goes in your
ship I shall sail with him.&#8217;</p>

<p>The young fellow drew backward from
my hand with a movement of astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Impossible!&#8217; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stop! Before you say a word&mdash;but
stay: wait till we have dined. I have much
to talk to you about. There will be no going
to St. James&#8217;s Park this afternoon.&#8217;</p>

<p>My maid had entered to lay the cloth,
and I broke off nodding and smiling at him,
and went upstairs to remove my outdoor
things.</p>

<small>SHE DRESSES AS A BOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> our sitting down to dinner I made him
gather by my looks that I would talk of
anything sooner than Tom before my maid.
When I had dismissed the girl, Will lay back
in his chair and said: &#8216;It will be a withering
stiff joke, Marian, if Butler sails in the <i>Childe
Harold</i>. It will be precious awkward for
me. I shan&#8217;t be able to speak to him, I suppose&mdash;not
even to nod, I dare say. A perfectly
innocent man, too; one of the best
sailors out of London or Liverpool, a man
who&#8217;s dined with father and mother and been
a welcome guest at their house.&#8217;</p>

<p>I waited a moment and then said: &#8216;And
my sweetheart, and husband some day. Why
didn&#8217;t you add that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was at the end of my tongue. It&#8217;ll
increase the awkwardness. It&#8217;s beastly unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
enough to see the friend of your
family dressed as a Newgate dandy and in
chains, but when you&#8217;ve got to cut him&mdash;I
mean when the sentinels won&#8217;t let you look
at him&mdash;he being all the while your first and
only cousin&#8217;s sweetheart and engaged to be
married to her! But if he&#8217;s to be one of our
convicts, I&#8217;ll take some big risks, Marian, to
let him know that I consider him as innocent
as I am, and that I&#8217;m all his friend down to
the very heels of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will, I have an idea, and I want you to
help me to carry it out.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you love me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;With all my heart, and will do anything
I can or dare do for you and Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tom is sure to sail in your ship, and I
must sail in her too.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But how? But how?&#8217; said he, a little
petulantly. &#8216;Haven&#8217;t I told you that the ship
won&#8217;t book passengers? They&#8217;ll reconstruct
her below decks fore and aft, and every inch
of her is hired for the lodging of convicts and
soldiers and sailors.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>&#8216;I mean to sail in her for all that. It&#8217;s to
be done, and I&#8217;ll tell you how I mean to do it.&#8217;
And here I got up and began to pace about
the room with excitement whilst I talked. &#8216;I
can&#8217;t ship as a woman, but I can ship as a boy
and as a stowaway.&#8217;</p>

<p>His face screwed itself up into a strange
expression of mingled mirth and amazement.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll make a smart-looking boy,&#8217; I continued.
&#8216;I saw a lad this morning that might
well have been a girl. The sight of him put
this scheme into my head. I&#8217;ll get my hair
cut close and dress as you do. I&#8217;ll have a
story ready; I&#8217;ll take a name, and when I&#8217;m
discovered I&#8217;m just a common runaway, one
of the scores of lads and grown men who every
year sneak into ships and coil themselves out
of sight and turn up far out at sea. And you
tell me, Will, this isn&#8217;t to be done?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;d do anything. You&#8217;d scrub Old
Nick white. What wouldn&#8217;t you do for Tom?&#8217;
said he, still preserving his kind of gaping
look. &#8216;But you&#8217;re never in earnest, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I swear by my dead father, I am, then,&#8217;
said I, confronting him and speaking in deep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
tones which trembled with passion, enthusiasm,
and resolution.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll get no clothes to deceive the eye
with that figure of yours,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;If that&#8217;s the sole objection, come here to-morrow,
Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The sole objection!&#8217; he cried. &#8216;One of
a score, you mean. What do you know about
the sea? Oh, yes, you can give the names of
things; but call yourself a stowaway, and tell
me where you&#8217;re going to hide?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You shall tell me,&#8217; said I, sitting close
beside him.</p>

<p>He ran his eyes over the room whilst he
reflected, and said: &#8216;Here&#8217;s to be a gutted
ship; keep that in mind. Down aft &#8217;ud be
out of the question; they&#8217;d have you out
before you warmed the hole you hid in, and
you&#8217;d be ashore packing along with a constable
before the Isle of Dogs was out of sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then it won&#8217;t be aft,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Forward! Why, yes,&#8217; he went on,
continuing to run his eyes over the room, in
his struggles to realise the inside of his ship.
&#8216;There&#8217;s the fore-peak&mdash;a big rat-trap, full of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
coals, spare swabs, broom-handles and oil-cans.
Could you hide down there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What! In blackness? Midnight with a
dense fog isn&#8217;t in it for blackness alongside
the fore-peak with a hatch on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What care I for blackness? I know
where the fore-peak is. It&#8217;s a place right
forward under the forecastle. It&#8217;ll be the
place for me to hide in. You&#8217;ll be able easily
to contrive to help me to drop below into it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re never in earnest?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t say that! I must be with Tom.
I have sworn to myself to follow him, and
wouldn&#8217;t it be a sure way, the only sure way,
of my being with him, of my getting to the
same place he&#8217;s bound to, of my ending all
risks of missing him and finding that he&#8217;d been
sent to another settlement which, without
friends to help me, I might never be able to
hear of&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t my sailing in his ship be
the only sure way for him and me to keep
together?&#8217;</p>

<p>The young fellow grew thoughtful as he
listened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>&#8216;I don&#8217;t say,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;that it&#8217;s quite
impossible; but look here, Marian. Suppose,
if only for the sake of argument, I call over
the roll of such objections as occur to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll suppose that you are dressed as a boy
and that you deceive the eye.&#8217; I nodded.
&#8216;I&#8217;ve agreed to sneak you on board, but how
am I to do it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A little thinking will show us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I succeed,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;in getting you
into the fore-peak unobserved. How long are
you to be kept below?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll go on board,&#8217; said I, &#8216;when the ship
is alongside the hulk. I&#8217;m your friend, a
visitor. You&#8217;ll be on the look-out for me.
Who&#8217;ll notice us? You&#8217;ll easily walk me
forward under pretence of showing me the
ship. Tell me this: Where do you ship your
crew?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;At Gravesend.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you sure?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I&#8217;m sure. The ship&#8217;s worked by
lumpers and riggers till the convicts are
aboard. We then drop down to Gravesend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
and await the crew, who arrive in a hoy in
charge of a crimp. All this I know. You
may take my word for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who occupies the forecastle until the
crew come on board?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nobody. The lumpers and riggers sleep
ashore.&#8217; His eyes brightened, and he cried:
&#8216;I see what you&#8217;re driving at! You&#8217;ve thought
it out pretty closely, Marian! But you&#8217;re
never in earnest, surely?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Go on with your objections, dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll suppose you&#8217;re safely stowed away
in the fore-peak. The convicts come on board.
I keep a bright look-out, and find that Butler
is not one of them?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have considered that,&#8217; said I. &#8216;You&#8217;ll
manage to communicate with me. If Tom is
not one of the convicts, I must come out of
my hiding-place whilst the captain is able to
send me ashore. If Tom&#8217;s on board, I&#8217;ll not
want to hear from you till England&#8217;s miles
astern.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How am I to communicate with you
down in the fore-peak?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll find out, dear. There are ways.
And aren&#8217;t you a sailor, Will?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>He laughed, but without much merriment,
and said: &#8216;Suppose I smuggle you into the
fore-peak when we&#8217;re off Woolwich. We may
be a week beating down Channel, and another
week before we&#8217;ve got far enough to suit you
to show yourself. Head winds are head winds
at sea. How are you going to feed yourself
in the black hole?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll lay in a stock of provisions,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s to stow the grub?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&mdash;by degrees.&#8217;</p>

<p>He laughed again and said: &#8216;How are
you going to find where the food is? You&#8217;re
not to be trusted with a light down there, you
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The food must be placed where I can put
my hand on it in the dark.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And before we&#8217;ve been twenty-four hours
under way the hatch is lifted, and down drops
a huge whiskered man called a bo&#8217;sun with a
lighted lantern right on top of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No hatch can be lifted in such a hurry,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;but that I can find time to hide myself.
But pray go on spinning these little cobwebs
which you call difficulties.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>&#8216;I&#8217;ve knocked up a regular barricade
already,&#8217; said he; &#8216;something bigger than
you&#8217;re going to climb, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you think so?&#8217; I said, smiling. &#8216;Well,
I&#8217;ll heighten your barricade for you, and still
you shall help me to scale it. I&#8217;m a boy
stowaway; I must carry nothing to sea but the
clothes I stand in. But you&#8217;ll ship a large
crew, and you&#8217;ll have a big slop-chest, so
there&#8217;ll be the materials for a rig-out when I
want one. I emerge when the proper time
comes and am walked aft to the captain.
Now, what will he do with me? He may put
me on the articles as an ordinary seaman.
That must certainly end in my helping the
cook or doing cabin-work. But then, there&#8217;s
my sex to fall back upon in case of impracticable
duties. I declare myself a woman&mdash;let
them invent a motive for my being on board;
they&#8217;ll find me dumb in that. Some of the
guard are sure to be married, the wives will
be on board, and there&#8217;ll be female quarters
for me if I own my sex. But it will be a
strong forcing of my hand to bring me to it.
Once a boy, Will, I&#8217;m a boy till I step ashore.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>He stared at me with admiration and
excitement, as though he listened to some
wild, romantic story of adventure.</p>

<p>&#8216;All that is material lies shaped in my
mind,&#8217; I went on. &#8216;Of course, a great deal
must be left to chance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What will father and mother think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They mustn&#8217;t know. Why need they
know, Will? Put it thus: In any case I go
where Tom is sent. That being certain, what
can it signify to aunt and uncle how I go?
Instead of following in a passenger ship, I
choose to make sure of my object in leaving
home by putting myself into the same vessel
with Tom. Your telling your father would
only lead to this: He and your mother will
tease me to death with representations of my
folly without causing me to swerve a hair&#8217;s-breadth
in my resolution. And they might
do me this mischief: with the best intentions
in the world, they might inform your captain
that I mean to dress up as a boy and hide
myself in his fore-peak. No, not a word to
father or mother, Will. This is quite my
business and our secret.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>All the while I was talking I was pacing
the room, occasionally stopping to gesticulate
or to approach him close and grasp him by
the arm. Now he got up and began to walk
about, too, rolling to and fro as though the
floor had been a ship&#8217;s quarter-deck, whilst
he swore that I had too much spirit for a
woman, that my scheme was too daring, that
if I knew what a fore-peak was like in a heavy
head sea, with the prospect of a fortnight of
blackness along with the risk of dying of
hunger and thirst, without possibility of escape
unless I was liberated, I&#8217;d quit the scheme as
hopeless.</p>

<p>But all this I had expected. I had never
dreamed he would immediately come into my
plans. He said he raised objections for my
sake, not for his own. To be sure, he would
get into very serious trouble if it was discovered
he had helped me to smuggle myself
into the ship. He was willing to take all risks
to do me a vast service and to make me
happy; but wasn&#8217;t it his duty to keep me, his
cousin, a handsome, well-nurtured, fine young
woman, out of the black and filthy fore-peak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of a merchantman and preserve me from what
might follow discovery?</p>

<p>I let him talk and feigned to sympathise
with his generous, sympathetic dread of the
consequence of my scheme. Yet some time
before we sat down to the tea and toast I rang
for, I had worked him by entreaty, sometimes
by tears, by eager impassioned representations
of possibilities of my plan into a partially
acquiescent mood. He kissed me, held my
hand, called me his sister, declared he would
help me if he dared; I must give him time to
think; he&#8217;d go on board his ship and take a
look round and talk over the matter with me
again. We arranged a meeting for the day
after next, and he left me after solemnly
promising to keep my plan and our conversation
secret.</p>

<p>I sat alone all that evening thinking of this
long talk. One objection of his perhaps sunk
a little with me when I was by myself musing;
he had figured me arriving at Hobart Town
where I was without a friend, and he had
imagined Tom being sent up country to a
part where the only house for miles might be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
the person&#8217;s to whom the Government handed
him. But I resolutely said to myself: I must
take my chance; this may not happen; in
any case I shall be in the country where my
sweetheart is.</p>

<p>Partly to please myself, and partly to
convince my cousin, I went to a large outfitter&#8217;s
shop in the Minories next morning,
and representing that I wished to make a
present of a suit of clothes to a young sailor
friend I asked the shopman to show me a
number of sizes in pilot coats and cloth
trousers. I said that I was about the height
and breadth of the young man for whom I
wished to buy the clothes. The shopman
measured me round my chest, took the length
of my arms and of my figure and then made
up a parcel of the clothing that came nearest
to the measurements. A lad walked behind
me to my house with this bundle, and sat in
the hall whilst I took the clothes to my bedroom
and secretly put them on.</p>

<p>The first suit I tried fitted me as though
cut for my shape; though the material was
stout, it buttoned loosely over me and gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
me the chest of a plump lad. The trousers
had the flowing cut of the tarpaulins of those
days; the swell of the cloth at the extremities
made my feet look ridiculously small, and I
saw that I should require stout boots if my
feet were not to betray me.</p>

<p>I stood in front of the glass and was
perfectly well satisfied with the figure I made.
I have already said that my beauty inclined
toward coarseness, and I counted upon this as
a perfecting touch for the masquerade when I
should have had my hair cropped close. I
kept what I needed, and paid the lad who
took away the remainder of the clothes. My
purchase comprised a cap, waistcoat, coat and
trousers, and a large red cotton pocket-handkerchief,
a flannel shirt, and a loose silk neckerchief
such as seamen wear in a sailor&#8217;s knot.
These things amply sufficed for the experiment
I desired to make.</p>

<p>Some time on the following day, before the
hour at which I expected Will, I dressed
myself in the sailor&#8217;s clothes, but my hair was
so thick and plentiful that I was scarcely able
to coil it all away upon the top of my head so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
as to secrete the bulk of it under my sailor
lad&#8217;s cap. After a fashion I succeeded; I
held up a glass and observed that, with the
cap on, the back of my head might very well
pass for a man&#8217;s at a little distance. I next
rubbed some rouge over my temples and
eyebrows and cheeks to give my face a look
of sunburn.</p>

<p>On the staircase I met my maid. She
started, and cried out, and stared, not in the
least degree recognising me.</p>

<p>&#8216;What pretty girl are you?&#8217; said I, &#8216;maid
or mistress? A fine woman looked out of her
bedroom window just now, and seeing your
hall door open I made bold to enter. Where
is she? I can&#8217;t find her.&#8217;</p>

<p>I spoke at length purposely to try an experiment
with my voice on her accustomed ear,
but seemingly my attire had changed my voice
as completely as it had transformed my figure.</p>

<p>&#8216;How dare you enter this house?&#8217; she
exclaimed, and then she began to screech out:
&#8216;Miss Johnstone, here&#8217;s a strange man in the
house. Mr. Stanford&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; And she ran downstairs
calling for Mr. Stanford.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>I sprang and caught her when she was on
my parlour landing and twisting her around
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you know me? I&#8217;m your mistress.
I wish to play a joke off on my cousin. Look,
do you know me?&#8217; and I thrust my face into
hers.</p>

<p>She uttered a variety of exclamations such
as, &#8216;Well, I never!&#8217; and &#8216;Who&#8217;d ha&#8217; thought
it?&#8217; and &#8216;Lor&#8217; what a handsome young chap
you make to be sure, miss,&#8217; and giggled and
blushed and eyed me from top to toe with
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you know me after looking a bit?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, miss. There never was no artfuller
make-up in a stage play.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Didn&#8217;t you recognise my voice?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It sounded like your figure looks,&#8217; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said I, &#8216;when Mr. Will Johnstone
arrives, open the door, show him in as though
you supposed I was in the room, and then
shut the door smartly upon him.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whilst I waited for my cousin I practised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
some walking. I got in front of the long glass
and advanced toward it, and marked such
points of my gait as I considered suggestive
and suspicious. I found my steps too short, but
after practising a little I guessed it would not
be very difficult to walk like a man. I looked
short in my clothes and appeared to have
dwindled six or eight inches, so greatly is
stature heightened to the eye by the long
robes of my sex.</p>

<p>Whilst I was rehearsing as a young sailor-man
in front of the glass, I heard Will&#8217;s knock
downstairs. I placed myself in front of the
window as though I was a stranger waiting.
The door of the room was opened and shut by
my maid according to my orders, and on
turning I saw Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I beg pardon,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I thought
Miss Johnstone was here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;ll be here shortly,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He stared hard and oddly, as though he
pricked his ears on my speaking, but certainly
he no more recognised me than my maid had.
I continued to look out of the window and
spoke with my back to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>&#8216;A pleasant day,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aye, it&#8217;s nice weather,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;You&#8217;re of my calling, I see. Been long
ashore?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve not been to sea yet,&#8217; I answered, half
turning my head his way to talk to him.
&#8216;My cousin Marian&#8217;s kindly taken me by the
hand and given me a rig-out and found me a
ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cousin Marian!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;I&#8217;m a
cousin of hers, too. What cousin might you
be?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My name is Simon Marlowe,&#8217; said I,
rounding upon him and looking him full in
the face. &#8216;My mother was Miss Marlowe.
Who are you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe he would have known me
even then but for the sudden laugh I burst
into at the sight of his face. That laugh was
my own, familiar to his ear as the whistle of
his boatswain&#8217;s pipe.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I&#8217;m shot!&#8217; he cried, with a gape of
astonishment, then burst into a roar, capered
up to me and, grasping me by the hands,
skipped to and fro like a savage, eyeing me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
all over and swearing whilst he danced that
he wouldn&#8217;t have known me in a hundred
years; that I was the prettiest little sailor-man
in the world. Twenty such things he said,
then released me to clap his hands while he
laughed until he was purple.</p>

<p>I pulled off my cap and tossed it on the
sofa and sat down, copying the rolling motion
of the seaman in every movement of my body.</p>

<p>&#8216;You must go upstairs and shift before I
can talk,&#8217; said Will. &#8216;Look at your hair! I
shall die of laughing.&#8217;</p>

<p>I ran to my bedroom, changed my clothes,
dressed my hair and returned. I was secretly
half wild to hear what he had to say, and had
no notion of spoiling this interview by keeping
him merry and roaring at my clothes. I
found him looking at Tom&#8217;s miniature.</p>

<p>&#8216;What a handsome chap he is!&#8217; he exclaimed;
&#8216;but I fear the hulk will rub some of
his beauty off.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no hulk afloat or jail ashore
that&#8217;s going to spoil his beauty,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;What can you tell me to give me heart?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you still in earnest?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t begin so, dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a wild, mad scheme,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;Father and mother will think me a fiend
for helping you instead of reporting you.
But I see this, you mean to follow Tom, anyhow.
No man living deserves such a magnificent
love as yours. You&#8217;re one mass of
loyalty and devotion from head to foot.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will, you are here to say you will help
me!&#8217; I exclaimed, bending toward him and
lifting my hands and clasping them in a posture
of prayer to him in the passion of
anxiety that was upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am more willing to help you,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;than I was when you talked to me the day
before yesterday&mdash;for this reason: I&#8217;ve been
on board the <i>Childe Harold</i>. She don&#8217;t tow
over to Deptford till Wednesday next. I met
our carpenter on the quayside, and asked
him if he knew how they meant to fit out the
vessel for&#8217;ard. He said he&#8217;d heard they
meant to bulkhead a space off in a line with
the forecastle entrance above, to serve as a
prison, the hospital to be aft. &#8220;Will they
leave the store-room bulkhead standing?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
said I. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he; &#8220;otherwise the
prisoners &#8217;ud be climbing into the forecastle
through the hatch.&#8221; I went aboard and had
a look. When I talked to you about the
black fore-peak, I had forgotten the line of
main-deck that runs right for&#8217;ard. The
space betwixt that line and the deck overhead
is used as a store-room. Why had I
forgotten this? Because, to tell you honestly
the truth, Marian, I was never once down in
that part of the vessel so as to remember
it. The store-room would make a different
hiding-place from the fore-peak I described.
The fore-peak&#8217;s under it. There they keep
the coals. You never could have hidden in
it. But the store-room should be middling
clean; black as a dog&#8217;s throat, mind you, but
not deep like the fore-peak. The forecastle,
where the men sleep, is immediately over.
If a person wanted to get out, he could
knock on the closed hatch, and there&#8217;ll be
men in the forecastle to hear him. The horizon
has cleared a trifle since I looked into
that store-room.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How big is this store-room?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>&#8216;A good size,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;Seven feet
high; the beam I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And the forecastle hatch is within reach
of my hand to thump at if I want to get
out?&#8217; I exclaimed. &#8216;It will be the one place
in the whole ship for me, Will!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no other place, and that&#8217;s a fact.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The stores&#8217;ll be clean and sweet enough,
I dare say&mdash;bolts of canvas, casks of stuff,
spare lines and such things. I&#8217;ll be able to
put myself out of sight if your bo&#8217;sun or any
other man should come down with a light.
I shall need water to drink. How about
that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re talking as if the job was settled.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is settled,&#8217; I cried, taking him by the
shoulders and playfully pushing him backward
in a sudden transport of mingled emotion.
&#8216;Is not fresh water to be sneaked
below whilst the ship&#8217;s fitting? I&#8217;ll think it
over and tell you how it may be done.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not coming to you to learn my business,&#8217;
said he with a toss of his head that ran
a gleam from his eyes like a sparkle of water
swept by a sudden wind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>&#8216;What are you going to do this afternoon,
Will?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come with me to the East India Docks,
and we&#8217;ll board your ship and talk things
over. We&#8217;ll then go the Brunswick Hotel,
drink tea there and settle everything.&#8217;</p>

<p>He eyed me doubtfully; his heart was
not yet in it, though the dear fellow was
coming my way. I went upstairs to dress
myself for the trip, the hour being about
three, with daylight enough to follow to serve
my end. Yet though we were together till
eight o&#8217;clock that night, talking and planning
and scheming, I found him still as reluctant
at the end as at the beginning. He had three
objections. First, he considered that his
keeping the matter secret from his father and
mother was like telling them a lie. Next,
Tom might not prove one of the convicts of
his ship. Suppose he (Will) should be unable
to communicate with me in my hiding-place
until I had been carried too great a distance
from England to be set ashore; I should be
in a convict ship, a woman locked up with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
rogues and villains, sailing to Tasmania for
no purpose at all, with the chance of missing
my sweetheart and never meeting him again
in this world. And, third, the young fellow
seemed to shrink from the notion of my being
alone in a colony.</p>

<p>I began to despair of him at last, and,
growing defiant after three or four days of
talking with him without his drawing closer
to my wishes, I resolved to look about me
and see how I might help myself, and I
plainly and hotly told him that, whether he
chose or not to give me a hand in my enterprise,
he would find me on board his ship all
the same, if it came to my spending a year&#8217;s
income in bribing the lumpers and riggers at
work on the vessel to conceal me.</p>

<p>He went away from this talk and nothing
then was settled; but on the following morning
he came by appointment to go with me
for a turn on the river as far as Woolwich,
and on our way to Blackwall he said he had
made up his mind to help me.</p>

<small>SHE TAKES A LODGING AT WOOLWICH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> gave me exactly a fortnight in which to
prepare for my departure, for now it was
settled that the <i>Childe Harold</i> was to drop
alongside H.M.S. <i>Warrior</i> on November 12,
receive her cargo of convicts next day, then
to proceed to Gravesend, where the crew would
come on board, and then head direct for the
Antipodes. What arrangements had I to make,
do you ask? First, as to the disposal of my
home. I had sometimes thought of selling it,
conceiving that if Tom lived to regain his
liberty he would abhor a country from which
he had been inhumanly and unjustly expelled,
and settle abroad. But on reflection I made
up my mind to keep the house, knowing that
it was always very saleable property should I
wish to convert it into money.</p>

<p>So, a day or two after Will and I had come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
to a thorough understanding and everything
was arranged so far as human foresight could
provide, I sent my maid downstairs to request
Mr. Stanford to see me. He came, and I
opened my business with him at once without
any needless civilities.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am going abroad, Mr. Stanford,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;I am going to leave England, and I make you
an offer of this whole house, furnished,&#8217; and I
named a price by the year.</p>

<p>He wished to question me as to where I
was going and how long I would be absent;
but my behaviour soon forced him to swallow
his curiosity and to confine himself to the
question of the hire of the house. It ended
in his agreeing to take the house off my hands
on my own terms, and that same day I got
Mr. Woolfe to draw up an agreement which
Mr. Stanford and I signed. I then wrote
to my trustees to inform them that I was
about to leave the country and gave them
instructions as to the receipt of the rent
from Mr. Stanford and the payment of my
income. The plate and many cherished objects
which had come to me from my father<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
and mother were packed and sent to my
bank.</p>

<p>I recount all this in a plain, sober-headed
way, but let me tell you, it was a time of wild
and frightful excitement to me. I had a
hundred things to think of, a hundred stratagems
to practise. I gave money to Will to
procure a stock of food for hiding warily by
degrees in the black lodging I was to occupy
under the forecastle. He found he could not
manage single-handed. Though he was an
apprentice in the ship and had a right to go
on board whenever he thought proper, his
services were not required until the vessel was
equipped and ready to drop down to Woolwich.
He feared he would be noticed and then
watched, if he was seen frequently to enter the
forecastle, and it ended in his bribing a rigger,
who was a brother of one of the crew of the
<i>Childe Harold</i> during her last voyage, to help
him to store water bottled for me to drink
whilst I was in hiding. The man asked no
questions, my cousin told me; he merely
grinned when he said that the stowaway was
an old schoolfellow of his, whose father had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
failed in business, and he grinned again when
Will tipped him two sovereigns.</p>

<p>For my part I was wholly fearless when I
looked forward. My heart beat high. I had
but two anxieties: One lest my uncle Johnstone
should discover what I was about and
stop me by warning the captain of the <i>Childe
Harold</i>; the other lest Tom at the last should
be detained on board the hulk for a later ship.
For this latter difficulty I had provided with
Will. But as to my uncle and aunt, I told
them plainly that I was going out to Tasmania,
and that I only waited to learn that Tom was
on board the <i>Childe Harold</i> to follow him by
the first ship. You will suppose that neither
of them had the slightest suspicion that my
ship was to be Tom&#8217;s convict ship herself.
How could such an idea enter their heads
unless Will blabbed, which he had taken his
oath not to do? Mr. Johnstone could never
dream that I meant to dress myself up as a
boy and hide under the <i>Childe Harold&#8217;s</i> forecastle.</p>

<p>One night, and that was the last I spent
at his house near the Tower, he talked of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
resolution to follow Tom till we rose to high
words. Will was out, or I dare say my temper
might have brought him to side with his
father and mother, which would have raised
a feeling between us, and ruined my hopes so
far as he went. Mr. Johnstone said he thanked
God I was no girl of his. He thanked God
his only child was a boy. What would my
father, if he were alive, think of my following
the fortunes of a convict?</p>

<p>I answered that my father was a true man
and would always wish me to be a true woman.
My father was not a man to oblige me to
betray and desert Tom because a dreadful
trouble had come upon the poor fellow; and
here I cried a little.</p>

<p>&#8216;Still, my dear, Captain Butler is a convict,&#8217;
said my aunt. &#8216;I wish to say nothing about
his guilt or innocence, but he wears felon&#8217;s
clothes, he is loaded with irons; he lives with
the scum of the nation&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And, guilty or innocent, he is irrecoverably
disgraced,&#8217; broke in my uncle.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why did you undertake his defence,
then?&#8217; I cried.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>&#8216;A man is innocent till he is proved
guilty,&#8217; answered my uncle. &#8216;By the logic of
the law I undertook the defence of a guiltless
person.&#8217;</p>

<p>This enraged me. It was like burning or
cruelly wounding or torturing me in any savage
way to speak ill of Tom or to cast a doubt
upon his innocence.</p>

<p>The quarrel was put an end to by my uncle
walking out of the room. I stayed a little,
wishing to cool down that I might say good-bye
with grace and heart, with something
indeed of the real love and gratitude I felt;
for I knew when I said farewell it would be
for the last time. But my aunt was cold and
vexed; she resented several things I had said
in the heat of the quarrel; she took my kiss
lifelessly, and I went out of the room. On
the landing I paused; I longed to return and
kiss her warmly and seek my uncle, that this
parting might have the tenderness my heart
longed for, now that my passion was ended;
but I said to myself: &#8216;No, they may suspect
a final leave-taking in my behaviour,&#8217; and so
I stepped into the street and drove home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>I had told my maid I was going abroad,
and next day I paid her and gave her a substantial
gift in money over and above her
wages, and she left me, crying. I grieved to
part with her. She was a good and faithful
girl, and would have been glad to go with me
anywhere, even to the other side of the world.</p>

<p>Five days before the ship was to haul
alongside the hulk I went to Woolwich, and
took a lodging as close to the river as the
respectable accommodation of that dirty town
permitted. I hired two rooms for the week.
The landlady asked no questions. She was
satisfied with my paying for the lodgings in
advance. After I had engaged those rooms,
I crossed the river afresh and returned to
Stepney to fetch a little trunk. I was to be
a stowaway, and of all ocean travellers the
stowaway is the one who sails with the fewest
effects. A hackney coach stood at the door
to convey me to Blackwall. I carried my
little box downstairs and put it with my own
hand into the coach. I then returned and
stood awhile in my room thinking. The walls
and tables were stripped of all that I cherished.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
The room looked somewhat bare. I slowly
cast my eyes around and thought of the past.
I conjured up my father and mother. I
recalled my early life, my lonely holiday trips,
much of what I had felt and suffered. I then
knelt down and prayed, rose and, going to the
wall, kissed it, and, with dry eyes but with a
sobbing heart, departed.</p>

<p>Whether Mr. Stanford saw me or not I am
unable to say. He did not appear, nor did I
catch a sight of him at his window.</p>

<p>No one knew that I had gone into lodgings
at Woolwich, not even Will, though I had
told him that I should be leaving my home on
such and such a date, and that he was to keep
a sharp look-out for me when his ship lay off
the <i>Warrior</i>. I did not want to burden him
with the obligation of telling lies. My uncle
might hear that I had quitted Stepney. He&#8217;d
ask his son where I was; and Will, with a
clear conscience, would be able to answer on
his honour he had no idea.</p>

<p>As you may remember, Tom had written
that I was privileged to bid him farewell
before he sailed. I thought deeply on what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
I should say when we met, and finally resolved
not to utter a syllable about my going with
him in the same ship. He was a sailor, and
would understand what I had made up my
mind to suffer and endure for his sake. He
might refuse, and sternly refuse, to allow me
to attempt the wild, extraordinary adventure
I had planned with Will. Indeed, I feared
his love. He was a man to give notice of my
intention sooner than suffer it. I guessed he
would not bear to think of my locking myself
up in a ship full of convicts. Well knowing
his own profession, he would say to himself,
when she is discovered how will she be treated?
If she maintains her disguise as a boy, what
sort of work will they put her to? If they
find out that she is a woman, what sort of
treatment will she receive from the master
and mates, from the officers in charge of the
guard, from the seamen forward? All this and
much more would run in his head, and his
love might betray me that he might save me.</p>

<p>Three days before the convict ship was to
haul alongside the <i>Warrior</i>, I went on board
the hulk. This time I gained the deck by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
dockyard stairs and the gallery that stretched
to her gangway. The sentry or warder,
in bright buttons and a glazed military cap
and a stiff stand-up collar with a bright crown
upon it, asked me my business, and bade me
pass when I told him that I was going to visit
a convict and explained that it was an errand
of farewell. It was a very gloomy sullen day;
a dark fog stooped to the breast of the river
and the water flowed seaward in a stream of
liquid greasy mud. The few ships in motion
oozed out of the fog, black, wet and gaunt,
and vanished with a sulky reel. The prison-ship
looked horribly grim and miserable; her
decks were dark and very damp, the fog
dripped from the edges of her boxed-up structures
forward, the cold gleam of moisture
glanced from whatever the eye rested on; the
pole-masts vanished in the thickness overhead;
and the air was bitterly cold with the chill of
damp.</p>

<p>A convict, in the dress of the felon, with a
bullet-shaped head and a flat face, stared at
me through one of the galley-doors; he had
badges upon one arm, and was probably a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
cook. Several warders moved about the decks,
and a soldier in a red coat, but unarmed, stood
forward, talking to somebody inside one of
the galleys. All the convicts were ashore at
their spirit-breaking work. I walked to the
quarter-deck. I saw no visitors. A warder
was approaching me at the moment when the
deputy-governor came up through the after-hatch.
I was unveiled, but whether he
remembered me or not, no look of recognition
was in his face. He asked me my business on
board.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have come to visit Thomas Butler,&#8217; I
answered, &#8216;a prisoner.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When were you here last?&#8217;</p>

<p>I gave him the date.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are too soon,&#8217; said he. &#8216;The rules
are every three months.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He wrote to tell me I was privileged to
pay him a farewell visit,&#8217; I said. He bade me
wait a minute, and walked to the governor&#8217;s
quarters. He returned soon, and said:
&#8216;Thomas Butler is one of a batch of convicts
who are to be sent across the seas on the 12th
of this month.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>&#8216;I know that,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will have to bid him farewell on
board the ship he embarks in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I shan&#8217;t be able to see him, then?&#8217; I
cried, putting on an air of consternation and
grief, that I might obtain some particular
information from him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am sorry you will have no other opportunity
of bidding him farewell.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But tell me, sir,&#8217; cried I, &#8216;shall I be
certain of seeing him if I go on board his
ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Undoubtedly. You will be allowed the
customary quarter of an hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How am I to know he will be one of the
convicts on board?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said he, very good-naturedly (and I
will say here that a kinder and better-tempered
man than the deputy-governor of H.M.S.
<i>Warrior</i> was not to be found among the prison
officials of his time)&mdash;&#8216;oh,&#8217; said he, smiling,
&#8216;there is no fear of his not being on board.
The surgeon has passed him. He is one of
the batch.&#8217;</p>

<p>My heart beat quickly on hearing this.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
He may have wondered at the effect of his
words. He darted a keen look, with an
expression of mouth that was like saying he
was not used to the friends of convicts exhibiting
delight on hearing that they were to be
shipped off.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you tell me how he is?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He gave me a sort of mocking bow as
though he would intimate that he had told me
enough. I took the hint and left the hulk,
wondering that under the circumstances the
warder or sentry should have passed me on
board, but greatly rejoicing over the information
I had received that Tom would undoubtedly
be one of the convicts of the <i>Childe
Harold</i>.</p>

<p>On reaching my lodgings, I wrote the
following letter to my sweetheart. I dated it,
but omitted the address:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8216;Dearest,&mdash;I visited the <i>Warrior</i> to-day,
but was informed that the regulations oblige
friends to bid farewell on board the convict
ship when the people are in her. If I do not
visit you to say good-bye, you will not wonder;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
you will understand there is a reason; you
know my heart as I know yours, and will not
mistake. We shall meet sooner than we think.
Many swift ships are weekly sailing to the
colonies. I kiss you and pray that God may
watch over you.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright2">&#8216;Your own</span><br />
&#8216;<span class="smcap">Marian</span>.&#8217;
</p></div>

<p>I addressed this letter and went out to
post it. It was then shortly after two o&#8217;clock
in the afternoon. Having posted the letter, I
walked a little distance until I came to a hairdresser&#8217;s
shop. I entered and said to a woman
who sat behind the counter that I wanted my
hair cut. She took me upstairs, and in a few
moments a man stepped in.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish you to cut my hair,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;The hends of it, miss?&#8217; said he, bowing
and smirking and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;The whole of it,&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes, but said nothing whilst
I removed my hat. He then exclaimed:
&#8216;That&#8217;s a beautiful &#8217;ead of hair to remove,
miss. Hall, do I understand? Or can it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
be singeing and cleaning that you want
done?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and pray be quick, for there
is not much daylight left.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took down my hair, and in the glass I
sat in front of I saw him fall back and admire
it. I also witnessed expostulation in his face,
and he stole doubtful looks at me in the mirror
as though he questioned my sanity; on which
I peremptorily repeated my request that he
would cut off all my hair. A woman&#8217;s hair is
her glory, they say, and I felt as though I was
parting with a crown of beauty as I watched
my long raven-black tresses in the glass falling
under the shearing snip of the remorseless
scissors. But there was a sense of triumph in
me, too&mdash;the elation of love&mdash;the feeling that
what I was doing was for Tom&#8217;s sake, and that
this was the very least of the sacrifices I was
willing to make for him.</p>

<p>I obliged the man to crop me as close
behind as though I were a convict, but to leave
me enough in front to part my hair on one
side. He did as I bid him, but when I came
to part my hair I found it stubborn; the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
parting down the middle would insist on
showing; so I told him to crop me close that
the hair might bristle on end.</p>

<p>When he had done so, I scarcely knew
myself. The man looked at the hair he had
cut off and asked what I wished to do with it.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said I, putting on my hat.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll give you a guinea for it, miss, and
throw in the job of cutting it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is beautiful hair and worth three times
what you offer; but you shall have it for a
guinea, nevertheless.&#8217;</p>

<p>He paid me the money, and I left the
shop. When I got to my lodgings, I locked
the door, dressed myself in the boy&#8217;s clothes
I had brought with me from Stepney, put on
my cap, and then stood upon the table that I
might see my full length in the chimney-glass.
I was perfectly satisfied with the appearance
I made. I looked just a hearty, strapping
young lad of seventeen, out and away more
manly to the eye than the saucy boy who had
kissed his hand to me. I sprang on to the
floor, and for a long while practised the paces
of a man, striding round the room and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
stretching my legs, and whilst I walked I
told over a few things I might require when
I should be hidden under the forecastle of
the convict ship, and paused at the table
from time to time to note down the articles.</p>

<p>And, first of all, I was resolved not to lie
in a black hole for a week, perhaps a fortnight,
without the means of procuring a light.
So I made an entry in my trifling list of wants
of a parcel of small wax candles of the very
finest quality, such a parcel as I could carry
in my pocket without observation. I guessed
that I should require a light only when I
wished to eat and drink, that I might see
where my food lay, and that the candles,
used for a few minutes at a time and at long
intervals, would last till Will released me. I
also put down in my list a tinder-box and
matches.</p>

<p>(My memory is at fault. I cannot recollect
that we had the common lucifer match in
1838.)</p>

<p>The other items consisted of a couple of
clay pipes, a clasp-knife, and a pair of strong
shoes that should thicken out my feet to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
look of a youth&#8217;s. These things, and the
boy&#8217;s clothes I was disguised in, comprised all
the luggage I intended to take.</p>

<p>The next day was unspeakably wretched
both to body and soul. It blew hard, it was
bitterly cold, and it rained incessantly, with a
frequent clouding of grimy sleet. I struggled
to the several shops to purchase the articles I
had jotted down, and then returned to my
lodgings, where I remained the rest of the
day. To-morrow the <i>Childe Harold</i> was to
haul alongside the hulk. I was to embark
upon a more wild, perilous, romantic, heart-shaking
undertaking than probably was ever
conceived by woman since the days of the
mother of all. I was banishing myself from
my home, from friends, from every convenience
and luxury of shore-going life within
the reach of my purse. I was going to hide
myself in the black and noisome hole of a
convict ship, without having the least idea of
what lay before me whilst I remained hidden
and after I should have been discovered. I
was going on a long voyage in a suit of boy&#8217;s
clothes and no other wearing apparel, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
should be taking my chance of being equipped
by the charity of the captain out of the ship&#8217;s
slop-chest, or of falling into rags, and so, perhaps,
discovering my sex, unless it should be
sooner detected, or unless I should find it
necessary to confess it.</p>

<p>Yet I had not the least fear; nay, I preserve
the recollection of an increasing emotion
of triumph swelling into elation and hope
and confidence as the hours of that wet, cold,
and miserable day rolled past and brought
me to the night whose dawn should start me
on my adventure. Never was my love for
Tom so great as now in this lonely time of
waiting in those Woolwich lodgings, when I
reflected that all I had done, was doing, and
yet hoped to do, was for him, that he might
know me to be true as the faithfullest of
women could be to the man of her heart;
that he might be gladdened by presently discovering
I was with him in the same ship;
that his guiltless spirit might be supported
by knowing we were together, that we should
arrive together, and that whilst his term of
infamous, unjust servitude lasted, I should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
never be far off, patiently and hopefully waiting
for him.</p>

<p>Yet I could not close my eyes all that
night. I seemed to catch the sound of the
storm-whipped river, though my lodgings
were at a distance from it. Would Will be
on the look-out for me? I kept on thinking.
Suppose he should be detained by illness
ashore; many things I supposed; and then
I thought to myself, if he should not be on
board, yet if I can contrive to enter the ship
it will be strange if I don&#8217;t find my way into
the hiding-place under the forecastle. But if
he is not on the look-out or, indeed, not in
the vessel, I shan&#8217;t be able to invent an excuse
to go on board of her. The guard will
be received at Deptford; the surgeon superintendent
will be already, no doubt, in the
ship; there will be mates and apprentices on
the poop and about the deck. I knew it
would be impossible for me to cross the gangway
without being challenged as to my business.
What, then, should I do if Will was
not on the look-out for me?</p>

<p>These were considerations to give me a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
sleepless night. I lay in bed till seven, then
rose, dressed myself in my ordinary apparel,
and telling the servant to have breakfast
ready by half-past eight, I passed out of the
house and went quickly toward the river.</p>

<p>It was still blowing fresh, but the morning
was dry, gray, hard with cold. I passed
through some mean little streets of small
houses, such as labourers would occupy.
Hard as the morning was, the mud lay soft
as grease in the roadways. Here and there
was a public-house, two of which&mdash;the
&#8216;Warrior Arms&#8217; and the &#8216;Justitia&#8217;&mdash;were
named after the prison-hulks. Though it
was barely good daylight as yet, these public-houses
looked as if they had been open for
some time. In places I tasted an acid smell
of stale beer and tobacco as I passed along
these mean little streets, and most of the
people I saw, dressed in a sort of velveteen
or corduroy, conversing near the public-houses,
many of them of the flat-faced type
of Englishman, with streaks of black hair
down their cheeks, and a habit of glancing
sideways without turning their head, might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
have passed for convicts enjoying a free-and-easy
half-hour.</p>

<p>I came within view of the river, and
looked along Woolwich Reach, but saw no
signs of such a ship as the <i>Childe Harold</i>
approaching. The hulks floated huge and
motionless off the Dockyard and Arsenal.
White clouds of fog were creeping over the
flats of Plaistow, and the river streamed cold
and yellow into the bleak gray haze of
Bugsby&#8217;s Reach. A waterman approached and
bade me good morning. I looked at the
man, and recognised him as one whose boat
I had hired on several occasions. He told
me he had come to settle on this side of the
river, as the Calais steamers and the hoys
were making business scarce for the likes of
him down the Stairs, Tower and Wapping
way. He asked me if I wanted a boat. I
answered no; I was waiting to view a convict
ship that I understood was to come
alongside the <i>Warrior</i> hulk that morning.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, that&#8217;s right,&#8217; said he. &#8216;You&#8217;ll be
catching sight of her any minute. The convicts
go aboard to-morrow, I believe. She&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
the <i>Childe Harold</i>. Too fine a ship for such
dirty service, to my mind.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whilst I stood waiting and conversing
with this fellow, who was one of the civillest
of his kind on the river, a handsome barque
under a main-topgallantsail came rounding to
abreast of us out of Galleon&#8217;s Reach, driven
by the fresh south-easterly wind. She was
painted green and cleanly sheathed; her
canvas was white as a yacht&#8217;s, and the whiter
for the contrast of the glare of it upon the
sullen gloom of the atmosphere. Her stem,
as though it were red-hot, boiled the water
at her bows; the white swirl rushed past the
ruddy gleam of the copper into a ribbon-like
wake of yeast, short and melting quickly for
the lack of brine, and the picture was one of
exceeding beauty and of inspiriting warmth
and colour. She swept into the haze of
Bugsby&#8217;s Reach, and vanished with a gleam
of her topmast canvas showing in a hovering
sort of way for a breath or two over the land
abreast of the East India Docks.</p>

<p>The waterman at my side was loud in
praise of her. &#8216;I haven&#8217;t seen a pootier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
barque in this here river since the <i>Arab Chief</i>
towed down some weeks since.&#8217;</p>

<p>I started and looked at him, and exclaimed:
&#8216;The <i>Arab Chief</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, the <i>Arab Chief</i>, the pootiest little
vessel out of any port of the country.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is she not a Liverpool vessel?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s her, mum. She sailed from the
Mersey and brought a cargo to the Thames.
There was a difficulty. The captain as had
her, &#8217;tis said, has come into one of them
hulks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When did she sail from London?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know, but I could easily find out
for ye.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Which docks did she load in?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe she hauled out of the London
Docks,&#8217; answered the man.</p>

<p>I struck my hands together, and said:
&#8216;I wish I&#8217;d known she was in the Thames.
I&#8217;m interested in that vessel. They charged
her captain with scuttling her. Not the
worst villain in any of those hulks yonder is
capable of a fouler lie.&#8217; I checked myself, on
observing the manner in which the man was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
regarding me; and, happening then to glance
up the river, I espied the towering fabric of a
big ship that was magnified by the haze into
the proportions of the masts and yards of a
line-of-battle ship looming astern of a little
tug whose smoke blew black and scattering
upon the level of the yellow water.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;ll be the convict ship,&#8217; said the man
at my side.</p>

<p>I gave him a shilling, and walked some
distance to be alone, and stood watching the
ship. She floated stately and grand in tow of
the tug; the Government stores in her were a
comparatively light lading, and she sat tall,
presenting a frigate-like height of side. She
was massive aloft in her sea-going trim, sails
bent, running rigging rove, royal yards across.
A small red ensign at her peak stood with the
wind like a painted board there. It was ebb-tide,
somewhat slack, and she came along on
the languid stream of it, head to the breeze,
with white water spitting at the bight of the
hawser betwixt her and the tug.</p>

<p>As she glided abreast I stared at her with
devouring eyes. Oh, she was the <i>Childe
Harold</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span> right enough! I was a sailor&#8217;s child,
and knew a ship after seeing her once as
you would know a face. Was Will aboard?
I would have given my left hand then for five
minutes&#8217; use of a telescope to make sure. I
saw a few figures on the poop and three or
four red-coats of soldiers on the forecastle,
but she was far too distant for the sight to
distinguish the people. I stood watching
until the tug had floated her abreast of the
<i>Warrior</i>, by which time I heard a clock strike
nine. I then walked quickly toward my
lodgings, half frozen with having stood for
about an hour and a half in that bitter morning
wind and in the atmosphere of the November
yellow river.</p>

<p>Though without appetite, I forced myself
to make what would be called a good breakfast.
The sitting-room adjoined the bedroom;
I rang the bell and toasted myself before the
fire whilst I waited until the maid had cleared
away the breakfast things. I then went into
my bedroom, unclothed and dressed myself in
the sailor-dress. This done, I mixed some
soot and rouge, and lightly rubbed the compound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
into parts of my face. The effect was
good; you would have supposed I was fresh
from the ocean. The clothes I had taken off
I made into a parcel and addressed it thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="gapright">&#8216;To the care of the Commander,</span><br />
&#8216;Government Transport <i>Childe Harold</i>,<br />
<span class="gapleft">&#8216;Off Woolwich.&#8217;</span></p>

<p>This I had made up my mind to do whilst
I lay thinking during the long and stormy
watches of the previous night. It was just a
speculation, and, good or bad, would amount
to little or nothing. The landlady of the
lodgings, on finding I did not return, might
send the parcel to the ship; if not, no matter.
The captain, on receipt of it, might hand it to
the steward to hold, concluding there was a
blunder somewhere. If he rejected it and
sent it back, still, as I say, no matter. I
valued not the clothes one farthing, but, I
had reasoned, if the parcel found its way on
board, and my sex should be discovered,
there would be my clothes in the ship ready
for me.</p>

<p>Having addressed the parcel, I put the
little packet of candles and the other few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
matters I had bought into my pockets, and
counted my money. I had between four and
five pounds, one guinea of which I had received
for my hair; and I need not tell you
that this was even more money than it was
prudent I should have if I was to act the part
of a stowaway supposed to be driven from
home by poverty; that is to say, if I should
come to be searched, which on board a convict
ship was extremely probable.</p>

<p>I paused to consider if more remained
to be done. I then opened the door and
listened, and, finding all quiet, slipped down
the short stairs, passed into the street, and
walked quickly in the direction of the Dockyard.</p>

<p>And perhaps I should repeat here that I
had paid the woman of the house in advance
for her lodgings, and that I had departed
leaving her in my debt, so to call it, for I had
purchased everything I had eaten, and left
enough behind me in groceries and the like
to last her for a week.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>SHE HIDES AS A STOWAWAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I felt</span> excessively nervous when I first set
out toward the Dockyard. I had never before
shown myself in public in male attire,
and imagined that everybody who looked at
me saw that I was a girl. I was somewhat
reassured, however, by a hulking fellow in
leggings crossing the road and asking me for
a pipe of tobacco. I told him I had none.
&#8216;A cuss&#8217;d lie,&#8217; he roared fiercely. &#8216;Gi&#8217; us the
plug out of your jaws, you damn&#8217;d shellback!&#8217;
I pushed on. He shouted after me,
and, though his language was by no means
refined, I did not dislike to hear him, for
what he said left me in no doubt that he took
me for a sailor.</p>

<p>I came to a place where I got a view of
the <i>Warrior</i>, and I saw the convict ship close
alongside of her with some of her yards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
braced forward clear of the pole masts of the
hulk. It was blowing very fresh and bitterly
cold, and the yellow ripples ran in little
showerings of spray. I walked to where the
wherry was to be had, and with some trouble,
after waiting and looking about me, found a
waterman.</p>

<p>&#8216;Put me aboard the <i>Childe Harold</i>,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you belong to the ship?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you&#8217;ll stand a drink I&#8217;ll save you a
couple o&#8217; bob,&#8217; he exclaimed; and I guessed
by the way he looked at the water that he
preferred to lounge in the warmth of a public-house
to taking a fare.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you mean?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tell the sentries you belong to the ship,
and they&#8217;ll let you go aboard through the
hulk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I want to go aboard in my own
way.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come along, then.&#8217;</p>

<p>I got into his boat and, after he had
breathed upon his hands and beaten his
breast hard, he fell to his oars. I looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
eagerly at the ship as we approached. The
consuming anxieties I had endured for weeks
and months, compressed into ten minutes of
sensation, would not have been harder to bear
than what I now felt. The waterman pulled
under the stern of the <i>Childe Harold</i>; a figure
standing on the quarter was visible; I believed
it was Will at first; he turned, and I saw he
was not my cousin. A flight of gangway steps
ran down the side of the ship, with a grating
at bottom, close upon the water, to step
on. The boat swung to, and the waterman
waited for me to step out. I gave him two
shillings, and kept my seat whilst I ran my
eyes along the line of the bulwark rail.</p>

<p>Where was Will? Was he not keeping a
look-out? Had I arrived sooner than he expected?
Nay, was he on board? And, as I
thus thought, my heart sinking like lead in
my breast with a sudden weight and passion
of despair, the dear fellow stepped into the
gangway and looked down.</p>

<p>He looked down, but he did not know me.
I cried out: &#8216;Will, oh, Will! There you
are! There you are!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>He stared again, but answered no further
than by beckoning, whilst he bent his neck
inward to glance forward and aft along the
decks. A soldier, but without a musket,
showed at the side at this instant, and looked
over into the boat, whistling. &#8216;Come up!&#8217;
said Will. I sprang on to the grating and
ascended the steps.</p>

<p>&#8216;How are you, old fellow?&#8217; exclaimed my
cousin, grasping me by the hand, and shaking
it warmly, admirably acting the part of one
who receives a welcome visitor. &#8216;This is how
we barricade the convicts, do you see?
How are all at home? On my word, this is
kind of you! My quarters are forward!
Come along and smoke a pipe, and then I&#8217;ll
show you the ship!&#8217;</p>

<p>The soldier lounged across the deck and
leaned against the barricade, looking at the
great hulk, whose topmost tier of grated
ports, and whose dingy height of bulwarks
and rude, hut-shaped structures forward
seemed to tower to half the height of the
convict ship&#8217;s lower masts. I darted a swift
glance round, and observed two figures on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
the poop, both young fellows. Some soldiers
stood forward near the convicts&#8217; galley. A
small group of men&mdash;lumpers or riggers&mdash;at
the main hatch within the barricade inclosure
were smoking and talking. I had no eyes for
anything but the people who were visible.
A heavy silence hung upon the hulk, and,
saving the voices of the group at the hatchway,
all was still on board the <i>Childe Harold</i>,
so that you plainly heard the hissing of the
strong wind in the rigging, and the quick,
fretful splashing of water rippling swift betwixt
the two ships.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your visit is exactly timed,&#8217; said Will.
&#8216;The captain&#8217;s ashore; the chief mate&#8217;s
below; the second mate&#8217;s indisposed in his
cabin, and the third mate&#8217;s in the hold.
Come!&#8217;</p>

<p>He motioned with his hands, as though he
showed me the ship. A woman stepped out
of one of the galleys with a bucket of hot
water, and passed us. She was a pretty
young woman, and she glanced at me with a
faint smile as she went by.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s a soldier&#8217;s wife,&#8217; said Will, speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
fast but softly, and pointing as though he
still showed me the ship. &#8216;There are several
on board, and a number of kids. You&#8217;ve
well timed your arrival. What marvellous
courage you have, and how confoundedly
well you look! There never was a smarter
sailor&mdash;to the eye. Where have you been?
Your skin&#8217;s brown. Been abroad? Surely
not. You haven&#8217;t had time. The ship&#8217;s
almost empty, you see. The crew&#8217;ll join at
Gravesend, as I told you they would. We
have a few runners on board from Deptford,
and twenty soldiers in charge of a captain
and subaltern&mdash;Lord, how I hate soldiers!
The convicts embark this afternoon or to-morrow
morning. There are only three apprentices,
including me, this voyage; two are
aft there on the poop. It don&#8217;t matter if you
are seen. They&#8217;ll think you went ashore by
way of the hulk. But I must get you below
before the chief mate comes on deck. I&#8217;m
supposed to be keeping a look-out at the
gangway, and I mustn&#8217;t be missed.&#8217;</p>

<p>All this he hurriedly said as we walked
forward to his quarters, which, as you may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
remember, were in a wing of the forecastle
on the port or left-hand side. He slid the
door open in its grooves and we entered.
A couple of hammocks swung under the ceiling;
three sea chests were secured along the
bulkhead; a little flap table hung opposite
those chests, and the rest of the cabin&#8217;s equipment
consisted of shelves containing tin
dishes, pannikins, knives and forks, and such
things.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should like to give you a kiss, Marian,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;but it would seem unnatural in that
dress.&#8217;</p>

<p>I answered by giving him a hearty hug.</p>

<p>&#8216;What pluck you have, dear girl!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will, we should lose no time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But some things must be said,&#8217; he exclaimed.
&#8216;Is there still doubt of Tom&#8217;s being
one of them, d&#8217;ye know?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;None,&#8217; and I repeated what the deputy-governor
had said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Still, I&#8217;ll watch the men as they come
aboard,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Where have you been since
you left Stepney?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In a lodging at Woolwich.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>&#8216;What a wonder you are!&#8217; He stepped
back to run his eye over me and said:
&#8216;They&#8217;ll never discover your sex whilst you
stick to that dress.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do your father and mother know I&#8217;ve
left home?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. Stanford called upon them. They
plied me close, but I could not tell them what
had become of you. They&#8217;ll board the next
ship for Tasmania and see if you&#8217;re in her.
Mother was at Deptford to bid me good-bye.
She&#8217;s very well, thank God. And so&#8217;s father.&#8217;
He put his head through the door to peep
along the decks, then pulling a piece of paper
from his pockets, said: &#8216;See here, Marian;
look at this sketch well, that you may remember
it. It is the interior of your hiding-place.
This square&#8217;s the hatch; those wormy-looking
things on the left are coils of rope;
those are cases and beyond are bolts of canvas.
This stuff amidships is a quantity of
twine. To the right are more casks; fresh
water, of which we shall need plenty and to
spare with two hundred and thirty convicts
aboard, not to mention soldiers and sailors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
and women and children. This tracing is
meant for spare sails. They&#8217;ll make you a
comfortable bed. I&#8217;ve cut this end adrift,&#8217;
said he, putting his finger on the tracing, &#8216;so
that you will be able to lie down and cover
yourself over after groping and feeling about
a bit. It&#8217;s devilish dark; that&#8217;s the worst of it.
And here&#8217;s a great timber which terminates
on deck in what we call a knight-head.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll find your stock of food and water
stowed close against that timber, shored and
hidden by a coil of rope.&#8217; He opened his
chest and handed me a knife for cutting tin.
&#8216;You&#8217;ll want this,&#8217; said he, &#8216;for the canned
grub; it&#8217;s mostly soup and bully. You&#8217;ll find
a pannikin for the water. I&#8217;ll visit you as
often as I can. Have you a watch?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. I&#8217;m a stowaway. I have run away
in poverty and must act the part. Keep this
for me, Will,&#8217; and I gave him what money I
had.</p>

<p>&#8216;The cook&#8217;s mate will be up and down for
coal,&#8217; said he, pocketing the money. &#8216;You&#8217;ll
get light when they lift the hatch, then you&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
hear voices and see people. Shrink out of
sight. Lie small, or all this trouble will have
been for no good.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If it should happen that Tom&#8217;s not one
of them, you&#8217;ll contrive to let me know before
we&#8217;re out of the Channel?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Trust me, old girl.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If he is one of them, you&#8217;ll let me know
when it will be safe to come out of hiding?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Trust me there, too.&#8217; He put his head
out to take another look at the decks, and
then said: &#8216;You&#8217;ll have to fib, Marian, when
you&#8217;re brought out. I&#8217;m sorry, but it must
never be known that I&#8217;ve had a hand in
hiding you. You will say, when questioned&mdash;and
it won&#8217;t be far from the truth, either&mdash;that
you bribed one of the Deptford riggers
to provision you. If they find the bottles
and the tinned stuff, they&#8217;ll go into the matter
closely. We may contrive that they shan&#8217;t
find anything; if they do, your yarn must be
called &#8220;The Rigger Corrupt; or, The Lie and
the Lumper.&#8221; Now wait.&#8217;</p>

<p>He went into the forecastle and returned.
&#8216;The coast&#8217;s clear. Come along!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>I followed him instantly. It was but a
step from his cabin to the forecastle entrance.
The gloomy interior was empty and silent.
Betwixt the giant windlass and the hawse-pipes
were stretched the massive links of the
chain-cable. I heard the tramp of a few
soldiers overhead, marching to and fro to keep
themselves warm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take that end of the hatch-cover and
lift with me,&#8217; said Will, in a voice of excitement,
looking behind him.</p>

<p>I put my hand to the cover, and between
us we raised it. The hatch was little more
than a man-hole, big enough to admit two
men at a time.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now look!&#8217; cried Will. &#8216;Have you the
heart? It&#8217;s not too late! See how black it
is! And you may be obliged to remain down
there a fortnight!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Give me your sketch of the inside,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He quickly handed it to me. I looked at
it and then put it in my pocket, and, without
another word, I put my foot on the ladder
of rungs nailed to the bulkhead, and in a
moment was at the bottom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>&#8216;Keep that hatch open whilst I take a
short look,&#8217; I softly exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;The mate&#8217;s calling me,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;I&#8217;ll come again, if possible, later on;&#8217; and
he closed the hatch.</p>

<p>The blackness was utter. I had heard
tell of dark rooms in which jail-prisoners
were locked up for punishment, but no dark
jail-cell could be blacker than the blackness
of this ship&#8217;s store-room. I stood for some
time motionless under the hatch where I had
stopped when Will shut me down; I hoped
to get the use of my eyes, and imagined
that this profound dye of blackness might be
owing to my coming out of the light into it.
The silence was that of a burial-vault: I
heard the swift beat of my heart in my ears
and nothing more. After a bit, small, delicate
worms or fibres of fire began to tremble
and crawl upon the blackness. I knew them
to be the phosphorus in my vision, and heeded
them not, but winked with a fancy of extinguishing
the strange flames.</p>

<p>I now moved a little way forward, stooping,
with my arms outstretched, and touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
what I might know by the hempen smell and
the feel of the stuff was a mass of twine. It
was dry, and I seated myself upon it. I will
not say that I was without fear; my heart
beat very fast. And yet even at this early
affrighting stage&mdash;for it was not only blackness;
it was loneliness also&mdash;I rejoiced in the
thought that I was in this hiding-place at
last; that every difficulty had been overcome;
that a most heart-breaking burden of anxieties
had fallen from me with my descent into this
hold, and that presently my dearest and I
would be together in the same ship, with a
future of possibilities before us such as I
could only have sighed for and wept for and
grieved myself into the grave for had I remained
at home.</p>

<p>I then bethought me: Suppose the hatch
should be suddenly opened, I shall be discovered.
I carefully lighted one of my little
wax candles, and, holding it up, looked around.
The flame was small, but it enabled me to see
as much as I needed. Will&#8217;s drawing of the
interior was exact. To the left were the
casks and coils of rope and bolts of canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and in the middle more coils of rope and a
mass of twine and a quantity of canvas
buckets, lanterns and so forth, and to the
right were the fresh-water casks and the sails.
Candle in hand, I easily made my way to that
part of the sails which Will had cut adrift. I
looked, and beheld stowed in the place Will
had indicated a quantity of black bottles and
tins, and a sack which I put my hand upon
and found half full of ship&#8217;s biscuits.</p>

<p>Still keeping the candle burning, I seated
myself on the loosened portion of the sail,
and found I could easily draw canvas enough
over me to conceal me in an instant at the
first alarm or to keep me warm when I slept.
I then blew out the light and replaced the
candle in my pocket, very grateful that I had
had foresight enough to provide me with the
means of seeing when I needed my eyes.
The blackness was at first insupportable, and
again and again my hand sought my pocket
for a candle; but I restrained myself when I
reflected this was but the beginning, and that
if I burnt out my stock of candles quickly I
might have to lie for a week or ten days or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
perhaps a fortnight in this blackness. I comforted
myself, however, by reflecting that
there would be noise enough overhead to relieve
this fearful oppression of stillness and
loneliness when the crew came on board.</p>

<p>I use the word &#8216;oppression.&#8217; It was physical.
My spirits were easy. My conscience
slept. What had I done that it should rebuke
me? I was proving myself faithful to the
man I had sworn to be true to, and whom I
loved with all the heart which was my life,
and with all the soul which was my intelligence.
I was offending no father, grieving
no mother, and, as to my uncle and aunt, I
knew this, that whilst I chose to hold myself
betrothed to a convict, it was all one to them
whether I followed him in my own fashion or
waited at home for his return.</p>

<p>By-and-by I thought I would make an
experiment, and creeping out of the sail and
groping about I touched a tin of preserved
meat. In those times provisions were not
delicately tinned as they are now. It was a
common practice then to seal up whole joints
of cooked legs of mutton and roast sirloins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
of beef in tins. Some of the tins Will had
stowed for me with the aid of his corrupted
lumper or rigger were of the size of small
drums, others were little; these contained a
sort of soup, well-known at sea, called soup
and bouilli. The first tin I touched was one
of them. I opened it easily with the knife,
and found the contents solid enough to be
removed in wedges. I then felt for a biscuit,
and made my first meal. I was obliged to
light a candle to seek for the pannikin; I
counted fifteen quart bottles of water, one of
which I opened, being thirsty. All these
things were well hidden within the embrasures
of the timbers and by the ropes and
other matters which fenced them round about.
I groped my way into the sail again after
blowing out the candle, always taking care
to command as much of the slack of the canvas
as would enable me to hide in a moment
if the hatch should be lifted.</p>

<p>Here now was I, fairly warm, tolerably
provided for, suffering from nothing worse&mdash;but
then to be sure nothing worse in its
way could well be imagined&mdash;than an overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
oppression of silence and a blackness
deeper than blindness. How does the
ordinary, the average stowaway manage, I
remember wondering? He sneaks in his
rags into dark, rat-hidden holes, and lingers
without food or water for days. Yet it is
contrived; the stowaway is the commonest
incident of ocean life: sometimes, indeed, he
is found a skeleton at the bottom of a chain-locker;
but it is the rule with him to emerge
ribbed, gaunt, half-nude; he is then set to
work, and lands well-lined with ship&#8217;s beef
and pork to flourish perhaps in a country
where he is wanted.</p>

<p>On a sudden I heard a strange noise. I
had been some hours in this place when I
caught the sound. It was a sort of dull
tremble, regular in its pulse, with a metallic
note threading it. I pricked my ears and
strained them hard, and my heart then began
to beat fast; no, I could not mistake! The
sound was the tread of many shackled feet
passing over the deck and descending the
hatchway and coming into the prison, whose
foremost bulkhead partitioned off the hiding-place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
in which I lay. The noise continued
like a flowing of water. I heard no voices,
not the dimmest echo of a human cry, nothing
but the dim thrill of the tramp of many feet
with irons.</p>

<p>Perhaps an hour may now have passed.
Suddenly the hatch was thumped as though
kicked, and the cover lifted. I pulled the sail
over me, leaving a corner for one eye to peep
out, and lay motionless.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll fetch it,&#8217; cried the familiar voice of
Will. &#8216;I saw the stuff stowed, and know
where it is. Here, give us hold of the lantern
and stop where you are.&#8217;</p>

<p>His figure descended; he then raised his
arm and received a lighted lantern. I dimly
discerned the shadow of another figure in the
hatch, the square of which lay in a faint
gray. Will stepped from under the hatch,
holding the lantern, and then put the light
down beside a cask, so that the shadow of the
cask was upon that part where I was. He
moved here and there in a seeking attitude
till he had approached the sail close; then
said in a whisper: &#8216;Where are you, Marian?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>I raised my head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hang me if you don&#8217;t roll up as though
you were the sail itself,&#8217; said he. &#8216;How do
you like it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s horribly black and lonesome, but I&#8217;m
content. I&#8217;d not be elsewhere.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The convicts are aboard, and Butler&#8217;s
one of them. I saw him and nodded. He
looks well&mdash;I mean pretty well.&#8217;</p>

<p>I started up and cried: &#8216;Will, if you see
him to speak to, don&#8217;t tell him I&#8217;m here. He
loves me too much to suffer it. He&#8217;d betray
me. He&#8217;d get me sent ashore.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;ll not say a word.
No chance indeed; you mayn&#8217;t talk to &#8217;em.
I can&#8217;t stop. The mate sent an apprentice
here for a canvas bucket. I took the job to
give you the news and see how you are. Anything
you want, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing, Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I forgot to tell you there&#8217;s the handle of
a scrubbing brush lying near your provisions;
you&#8217;ll easily get it by feeling. You&#8217;ll need it
to knock with should you want to get out.
Bless you, my brave old woman!&#8217; and so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
whispering, he took a stride, picked up a
bucket, handed it and the lantern up, and
sprang through the hatch, which immediately
afterward was closed.</p>

<p>The news of Tom being in the ship so
cheered up my heart that I could have sung
aloud amid that black silence. I kept my
eyes shut that I might not see the blackness,
and tried to figure the interior of the prison
ship. What sort of quarters had the convicts?
Should I ever have a chance of viewing
the &#8217;tweendecks? I recollected that Will
had told me the prison&mdash;by which I understood
the cell in which the convicts would be
confined for punishment&mdash;was just the other
side of the bulkhead or partition. I strained
my ears, thinking I might catch a sound of
the felons talking. The fancy seized me to
draw close to the partition; I got out of the
sail and felt along it, knowing that the extremity
would bring me to the bulkhead.
Putting out my hands, I felt the bulkhead,
pressed my ear to the solid wooden wall and
listened, but heard nothing; nothing, that is,
resembling a human voice. But I caught a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
sort of scuffling sound, very dim and weak,
as though of many feet in motion; it was a
wild, strange noise to listen to in that blackness.</p>

<p>I groped my way back to where the sail
was loose, and lay down and covered myself
as before. I had thought to find the atmosphere
ice-like, yet I was not cold, being
warmly clad, with plenty of sail-cloth to cover
me besides. I kept my eyes closed to lighten
the weight of the blackness upon the brain.
My thoughts were with Tom, with our visit
to this ship in the docks, with my home in
Stepney. It was like taking a bruising load
off my heart, to think of my sweetheart as
having left the grim and horrible hulk for
good, as having turned his back for ever upon
the killing labour of the dockyard. It was
as though he had taken one long step toward
freedom. I shuddered, and my soul was sick
with loathing when I thought of the hulk, of
the four hundred or five hundred wretches
imprisoned throughout the long winter&#8217;s night
in her, of the squalid rows of houses and dismantled
craft along shore, of the mud and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
drizzle and the fogs upon the flat and reeking
lands and the bleak spirit of the streaming
yellow Thames in all things, soaking chill to
the core of whatever the eye rested upon,
giving a sterner significance even to man&#8217;s
deepest intent of degradation.</p>

<p>And then I wondered what would happen
when I showed myself or was discovered.
What kind of work would they put me to?
Would they force me to reveal my sex? I
hoped not; I prayed not: for the discovery
might lead to their finding out that I was a
convict&#8217;s sweetheart, and they would land me
at the first port the ship touched at and ruin
my scheme, and separate me, perhaps eternally,
from Tom.</p>

<p>I fell asleep. I could not name the hour.
Time had no being in that blackness. A noise
awakened me. Instinct was alert even in my
slumber, for the instant I awoke I pulled the
canvas over my head, leaving one corner for
my eye, and lay still as a corpse. The hatch
was open and a figure stood under it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hand the blooming shovel down,&#8217; the
fellow called out. &#8216;Never keep poor convicts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
awaiting for their breakfisses. Time enough
to sarve &#8217;em so when they becomes pious and
turns &#8217;spectable sailor-men. Blowed if this &#8217;ere
hatch ain&#8217;t froze! Len&#8217;s a hand to lift the
cover.&#8217;</p>

<p>A second figure dropped below. The
light was so dim in the hatch above that I
could distinguish nothing but the shadowy
shapes of the two fellows. The hatch in the
deck of the store-room was lifted. One man
climbed out and handed down a shovel and a
lantern, and the other descended with them
into the fore-peak. A bucket was let down,
and I heard a shovelling of coal in the bowels
below. Presently a faint cry sounded. The
bucket was drawn up, emptied into some
noisy receptacle above, and lowered again.
This business lasted nearly half an hour; the
fellow below uprose with the shovel and lantern
and put the lower hatch on, swearing
to himself. He then climbed through the
second hatch, which he also closed, and my
hiding-place was plunged afresh into blackness.</p>

<p>I gathered from their speaking of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
convicts&#8217; breakfast and from their procuring
coal, no doubt for the galleys, that it was
early morning, and that I had slept through
the night. A long, dreamless, death-like
sleep it must have been in that black and
silent place. The moment I sat up I was
sensible that the ship was in motion. I
seemed to feel that she was being strained as
though dragged. Subdued noises broke from
various parts of her, the creak of timber and
of bulkhead; but the ship floated without
the least motion; indeed, I was sure she
could not long have left her berth alongside
the hulk.</p>

<p>I lighted a candle, drank from a bottle of
the water, and, having helped myself to some
meat and a biscuit, I extinguished the candle
and broke my fast in blackness. I did not now
find this blackness the great oppression it had
at first proved. I have heard that the governor
of a jail considered three days of confinement
in a black cell a trifling punishment until he
tried it. He caused himself to be locked up
for twenty-four hours; at the end of that
time he could stand the blackness no longer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
and he was ever after of opinion that twenty-four
hours was as long as it was safe to keep
a man locked up in the blackness at one
stretch.</p>

<p>This may be true of prison blackness.
Speaking for myself, I ceased to suffer, after a
time, from privation of light; though under
that ship&#8217;s forecastle, with the hatch on, the
blackness was as intense whilst the silence
had been as profound as ever human ingenuity
could contrive with bricks and mortar ashore.
But, then, I had a moral support which the
prisoner would be without. I was animated
by the strongest of human passions; it
gladdened me, moreover, to feel that I was
sharing in my sweetheart&#8217;s suffering and
exile; and then, again, what I was enduring
was of my own seeking, long awaited with
impassioned eagerness.</p>

<p>By-and-by the sensation as of the ship
being strained or dragged ceased, and the
noises made by the timbers and in the hold
were silenced. I guessed by this we had
brought up off Gravesend, and roughly
worked out a notion of the hour by first supposing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
that we had started from Woolwich at
seven and that we had towed at the rate of
five miles an hour. Gravesend is about
eighteen miles from Woolwich by water, and
therefore I reckoned the hour to be drawing
on to eleven o&#8217;clock. All this while I lay
close in the sail; I never knew the instant
when the hatch would be thrown open. All
was still overhead, so I judged that the crew
were not yet come on board.</p>

<small>HER SUFFERINGS IN THE HOLD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I lay</span> thinking just as one would in bed
through the blackness of a long night: and
in this way three or four hours went by.</p>

<p>It was then I heard a noise overhead, a
very great hurry of feet, and sounds as of
drunken shouts and singing dulled to the ear
by the thickness of the plank. I knew by
this that the crew were come, and I felt
mighty grateful, for now I could be sure that
we should soon be under way for the Channel.
I supposed that the ship had brought up at a
mooring buoy; certainly I should have heard
the thunder of her cable roaring just over my
head had she let go her anchor.</p>

<p>I got some biscuit and meat, and whilst I
was eating in my sail the hatch was lifted. I
immediately whipped under the canvas and
lay like a mouse, watching in my fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
that is, with one eye at the edge of the bolt-rope
of the sail. Three men came down,
and a minute later a fourth followed. I lay
motionless and terribly frightened, for they
stood under the hatch looking round as
though considering where to seek for what
they came for. The open hatch yawned in a
square of pale gray light; I was able to see
the men, but the forward part of the place
where I lay was sunk in gloom. The biggest
of the men, a great burly fellow of a seaman,
advancing two or three steps, stopped and
began to count. I understood he was counting
the casks.</p>

<p>&#8216;Eight,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;I told you that, sir,&#8217; said the voice of
Will. &#8216;I saw them stowed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So much the better,&#8217; answered one whom
I reckoned to be a mate, perhaps the second
or third mate. &#8216;I&#8217;ve allowed for six. There
can&#8217;t be too much spare water for such a
company as we&#8217;re carrying.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Right you are there, sir,&#8217; exclaimed the
burly man in a deep voice. &#8216;Sails, here&#8217;s
twine for ye.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>&#8216;I see it,&#8217; said the third man, stooping
and seeming to feel. They continued for a
short time to talk about the contents of this
store-room. I heard Will say the chief mate
had ordered him to count the spare buckets.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do so,&#8217; said the man whom I supposed to
be the second or third mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bo&#8217;sun, hand us down a light. I can&#8217;t
strike fire with my eyes,&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>The three men went up through the
hatch, leaving Will standing alone under it.
I now distinctly heard the sound of many
voices; most of the newly-arrived crew
seemed intoxicated if I might judge from
their tipsy laughter and maudlin songs and
calls. A light was handed down; Will
screened the lantern by setting it beside a
cask; he then came over to me. I lifted my
head.</p>

<p>&#8216;There you are,&#8217; said he softly. &#8216;How
are you getting on, old girl?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well, Will. I have slept right
through the night, and very comfortably.
Give me all the news.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You may hear it,&#8217; said he, laughing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
&#8216;The crew are aboard, drunk as casks. A
sweet and noble lot of hearts. You never
saw such a crew. The most ruffian-looking
convicts are gentlemen beside some of them.
The crimp who brought them down fished
every gutter &#8217;twixt Houndsditch and Limehouse
Hole, and rejected half he hooked as
not bad enough.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then we&#8217;re off Gravesend?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When do we start?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The tug will be catching hold of us
before dark. Any rats here, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;None, so far. Have you seen anything
of Tom, dear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>He stepped to the lantern and held it to
my face to look at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a good job,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that you&#8217;ve
got no hair to dress. But how jolly bright
your eyes are! Perhaps I may have you out of
this sooner than you expect. Pray for a fresh
north-easter, Marian.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Take your light away and count your
buckets. Somebody may come below.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>&#8216;I&#8217;m not going to count any buckets,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;I invented that yarn as an excuse
to see you.&#8217;</p>

<p>He carried the lantern to where my provisions
lay, and was looking at them and softly
speaking, when a man fell right through the
hatch. He fell with a mighty thud, and I
screamed out. You would have supposed
him killed or stunned, but he had not lain
quiet one or two minutes, not long enough
indeed for Will to get to him, when he began
to laugh and mutter drunkenly. He then sat
up, and, looking about him, exclaimed: &#8216;Rum
casks, be gob! Whist, ye drunken teef, and
they&#8217;ll lock ye up down here!&#8217; So saying,
he got upon all-fours and crawled toward the
casks stowed in the left wing of this store-room.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you doing here?&#8217; cried Will,
stepping up to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it you, honey? Bedad, then, that
makes two. Quick, sweetheart, with your
gimlet and pannikin, for supposin&#8217; it should
be threacle!&#8217; said the man, sinking into a
sitting posture.</p>

<p>My terror was extreme. I feared that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
others of the drunken crew would follow this
fellow and come tumbling down after him to
rummage for drink, and discover me before
enough sober men could be got together to
turn them out.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, up you go!&#8217; cried Will. &#8216;Out you
get!&#8217; And he put his lantern down to lay
hold of the man.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, what divvle are you?&#8217; answered
the brute, in a voice suddenly savage and
dangerous as the growl of a fierce dog.
&#8216;What&#8217;s this?&#8217; he roared. &#8216;A stowaway?
Hooroo! A stowaway, bullies! Hooroo!&#8217;
and, staggering on to his legs, he lurched
towards the lad, with his fist raised.</p>

<p>Will was as stout a young fellow as ever
buttoned a pea-jacket over his chest. He
struck, and the man dropped like a shot from
the hand. Excitement and fright had carried
me out of the sail. I grasped the broom-handle
and was in the very act of rushing to
help Will, when the fellow was dropped by
my cousin&#8217;s fist.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s going on down there?&#8217; roared a
hurricane voice through the hatch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>I sprang back upon the sail and covered
myself.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s a drunken scoundrel, bo&#8217;sun,
pitched headlong down here and refuses to
turn out!&#8217; cried Will.</p>

<p>The burly figure of the boatswain came in
a sprawl down the ladder. Then followed a
real forecastle scuffle. The boatswain went
to work with legs and hands, kicking and
hauling. The drunken Irishman blasphemed
most horribly. Heads collected at the hatch,
and the fellows up there roared to their
wrestling, drunken, cursing shipmate to fight
it out and die game. But Will and the boatswain
between them proved too much for the
ruffian, and, after a fierce struggle, they
dragged him up through the hatch, with his
old coat in ribbons. Will then descended
for the lantern. He breathed very hard, and
looked my way as though he would speak.
I sat up and passionately waved to him to
depart. He saw my gesture by the light he
held, flourished his hand, and, climbing the
hatch, put the cover on.</p>

<p>This was a terribly narrow escape, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
felt all the weakness of my sex&#8217;s nature as I
sat in the blackness and realised that had
the other drunken sailors tumbled below I
should have been discovered and my hopes
ruined.</p>

<p>After this I passed some wretched hours,
for I never knew but that the drunken
Irish sailor had told the others there were
casks under the forecastle full of strong drink,
for all he could guess, and I kept on fearing
that amongst them they&#8217;d lift the hatch and
descend. However, nothing of the kind happened;
I got more heart as time went on and
the hatch remained untouched. I heard a
great deal of thumping overhead, and treading
of feet as of men coming and going, and
then I felt once more the same straining sensation
in the ship I had before taken notice
of; I supposed we were under way, in which
case the <i>Childe Harold</i> had fairly begun her
voyage.</p>

<p>Saving the occasional lifting of the hatch
at long intervals when a man went below into
the fore-peak to shovel coals and send them
up in buckets, nothing broke the overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
monotony of that black and silent time
of concealment. But there came an hour,
whether it was in the day or night I cannot
tell, when I was awakened out of a deep sleep
by many violent noises and a wild movement.
The ship was at sea; she was breasting the
waters of the Channel; and seemingly a
strong sea was running, for she pitched deep
and raised a most extraordinary roaring noise
of foaming brine all about her bows, in the
very &#8216;eyes&#8217; of which I lay. For some
minutes I was not sensible of the least inconvenience;
I sat up in my bed of sail wondering
at the novelty of the motion and the
noises; but then I was visited by a most
deadly nausea&mdash;I felt as though I were swooning
into death; indeed, the pitching motion
was outrageously heavy for one inexperienced
as I was to waken up to. I was just in that
part of the ship where the pitching is most
felt. I sank back and suffered&mdash;oh, how I
suffered! Think of me, alone in that midnight
blackness, without a sup of cordial to
give me a little life, as incapable of stirring as
though I were dying, feeling to the height of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
its anguish the sickness that is the worst of
all sickness, hearing nothing but the cataractal
rushing of water against the bows, the
sudden shock and thunder of a great sea
smiting quick and hard as the blow of a rock,
the crazy straining of timber and cargo and
strong fastenings.</p>

<p>In this wretched state I continued for two
days. I afterwards calculated this time, and
found that it must have run into two days
and a night. I never ate nor drank; I may
say I neither slept nor waked; I lay in a sort
of middle state. Will never came near me; but
through no fault of his; he later on told me
his hands had been full whilst on deck, he
could not invent an excuse to visit the store-room,
and without a good excuse he durst
not lift the hatch lest I should be discovered
and he be charged with hiding me.</p>

<p>However, whether it was that nature could
suffer no more, or that the movement of the
ship even in this extreme fore part had fallen
into softness and rhythm, I slept and awoke,
and, awaking, found myself free from nausea
and hungry. I sat up and lighted a candle;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
my hand shook with weakness, and I could
scarcely stand. I drank from a bottle of
water, took such food as I wanted, and made
a meal. I kept the candle burning, for I was
now thinking that my term of imprisonment
might be drawing to an end, and that I could
afford the luxury of a light. Indeed, I had
not as yet consumed a whole candle since I
had been in hiding.</p>

<p>I sat by the light of the candle till it was
burnt out; the light cheered and soothed me.
It was something for the eye to rest upon,
and the flame was a sort of companion in its
way. Once it put a horrid, frightful fancy
into my mind. I thought to myself, suppose
I set fire to the ship? The vessel has
boats! besides, we are still in the English
Channel, and help is near and abundant. The
convicts would scatter, some going in one
boat, some in another, or the ship might be
run ashore to save life, and Tom escape. I
shuddered, and blew out the light, which was
now burnt to within half an inch of the
candle.</p>

<p>I felt stronger and more comfortable. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
ship plunged softly; I heard no roaring of
the brine outside, no blows as from the shock
of thunderbolts; I guessed that the weather
was fair and gentle; but was it night or day?
I could not imagine. I had figured the high
sun pouring upon the white canvas and the
sea blue and splendid under him, and in that
deep, vault-like blackness I&#8217;d pant for the
sweetness of the air above and yearn but for
ten minutes of the glory of the day. Then,
in the same breath, I&#8217;d think &#8216;It may be midnight.
The sun has sunk, and a thousand
stars tremble over the mastheads, and a corner
of moon is lifting out of a length of
ragged, black cloud hanging low over the
blacker water.&#8217;</p>

<p>When would it be time for me to beat
upon the hatch and take my chance of what
was then to follow? In any case, I dared not
reveal myself till Will gave me notice, for
how should I be able to tell where the ship
was&mdash;whether she was not still close in with
the English shore, so that the captain could
land me, end my scheme, and render all I
have done and suffered useless? I must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
patient; better that Will should make no
sign for a month than that I should emerge
one hour too soon.</p>

<p>The time crept on. I heard an occasional
movement of feet overhead, but all the noises
were small and brief. Indeed, it was the ship&#8217;s
forecastle, the place where the sailors ate,
drank, and slept; where, unless all hands are
on deck, there is always a watch below and
consequently sleepers; so that when the voyage
has fairly begun and the men have settled
down to their work, there is no quieter place
in a ship than her forecastle.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
